Thread commands

Every command supports --json for machine-readable output.

Spawning:

  bb thread spawn --project <id> --prompt "..." [options]
  bb thread spawn --project <id> --prompt-file <path> [options]

    --prompt <prompt>              Initial prompt (one of --prompt or --prompt-file is required)
    --prompt-file <path>           Read the prompt from a file; `-` reads stdin. Use this for
                                   multi-line or Markdown prompts: inside double quotes the shell
                                   runs `backticks` and $(...) before bb sees them
    --title <title>                Thread title
    --project <id>                 Project (required; when omitted the error prints this thread's project ID to add)
    --parent-thread <id>           Parent thread (may be in another project)
    --parent-self                  Parent to the current thread (BB_THREAD_ID)
    --lifecycle-owner-thread <id>  Archive/delete with this owner
    --provider <id>                Provider override
    --model <model>                Model override
    --reasoning-level <level>      Reasoning level: low, medium, high, xhigh, max (provider-dependent)
    --environment <id-or-path>     Attach to an existing environment (ID or workspace path)
    --new-environment <kind>       Create a fresh personal workspace or managed worktree
    --base-branch <branch>         Exact Git ref for a new managed worktree
                                   (--new-environment worktree only)
    --environment-provider <id>    Run on an environment provider by id (list them with
                                   `bb environment providers`). The provider
                                   provisions where the thread runs; its steps show in the
                                   thread's workspace-setup block. Its `requires` names the
                                   facts it consumes: `host` takes --machine (the local
                                   machine by default); `gitCheckout` needs this project's
                                   checkout on that machine to be a Git repository with
                                   commits; `gitRemote` needs a project remote;
                                   `projectless` serves only threads with no project.
    --environment-inputs <json>    JSON value for an --environment-provider that declares
                                   inputs; `bb environment providers --json` prints each
                                   provider's inputs as JSON Schema (null when it takes
                                   none). Required when the provider declares inputs,
                                   refused when it does not
    --machine <id-or-name>         Run on a machine (--host is an alias)
    --service-tier <tier>          Service tier id the provider lists for the model, such as
                                   default or fast (see `bb provider models`)
    --permission-mode <mode>       Permission mode: accept-edits, auto, or full
    --plan                         Send the prompt as the provider's /plan action (plan first, execute after approval)
    --section <id>                 Create the thread in a section
    --pinned                       Create the thread in Pinned
    --visibility <visibility>      visible or hidden; a child inherits its parent by default
    --send-at <when>               Dispatch the first message at an ISO 8601 timestamp or a duration from now (30s, 10m, 2h, 7d)
    --file <path>                  CLI-local absolute path, file: URL, or uploaded file path
    --image <path>                 CLI-local absolute path, file: URL, or uploaded image path
    --origin-kind <kind>           Create a fork thread
    --source-thread <id>           Source thread for a fork
    --source-seq-end <seq>         Fork after the source turn containing this event sequence

  Execution defaults resolve from explicit flags, live parent execution, and
  remembered project defaults. With no remembered model, bb uses the explicitly
  requested provider or Codex and resolves its provider-reported default model
  on the target machine. The product reasoning and permission defaults are
  medium and auto.
  accept-edits uses workspace sandboxing with user-reviewed escalation. auto uses
  the same workspace sandbox with provider-native automatic review. full is the
  explicit sandbox and approval bypass. Plan mode is separate from permissions.
  Subagents inherit the parent's permission mode by default, adapted to the child provider's supported modes. Explicit requests and a thread's recorded mode take precedence; nesting a thread does not cap its permissions. The host permission ceiling still applies.
  Parenting is opt-in. Inside a thread, pass --parent-self to parent the new thread to the current thread.
  Hidden threads are for plugin/background workers. They remain addressable by
  ID while staying out of sidebar organization and unread/pending favicon
  attention. Thread lists exclude them unless
  --include-hidden is passed; direct-ID operations remain available.
  A new child thread inherits the visibility of its parent, so the subagents of
  a hidden thread stay hidden too. Pass --visibility to override the inherited
  value. A hidden child still reports its turns and blockers to its parent
  thread; only source-derived forks stay silent.
  A machine selector accepts an exact ID or an unambiguous name. It works with
  an unmanaged --environment path, --new-environment worktree, or the personal
  workspace. It cannot be combined with an existing environment ID because that
  environment already selects its machine. Without the flag, local/server
  machine resolution is unchanged.
  Omit --base-branch for bb's default. Explicit values are exact; use
  origin/<branch> for a remote ref.
  Before selecting a provider, run `bb environment providers --project <id>
  --machine <id-or-name>` to see whether it is available, needs setup, or is
  unavailable and why. The first-party providers are Project checkout,
  Worktree, and Personal workspace.

Handoff:
  In the follow-up model picker, Handoff to new thread starts a new-thread
  draft with a reference to the source thread. Choose any model, including
  one from the current provider. Exit handoff restores the original execution
  settings and keeps draft edits, removing the automatic source reference.
  Closing the picker keeps handoff active; the composer also has Exit handoff.
  CLI callers can use bb thread spawn with --provider, --model, --environment
  and --prompt 'Continue from @thread:THREAD_ID ...'. SDK callers use
  threads.spawn with the corresponding execution, environment and input fields.

Forking:

  bb thread fork <source-thread-id> [options]

    --prompt <prompt>              Optional first prompt; omit for an idle fork
    --prompt-file <path>           Read the first prompt from a file; `-` reads stdin
    --lifecycle-owner-thread <id>  Archive/delete with this owner
    --source-seq-end <seq>         Fork after the source turn containing this event sequence (tip by default)
    --environment <id-or-path>     Existing environment ID or unmanaged workspace path
    --new-environment <kind>       Create a fresh personal workspace or managed worktree
    --base-branch <branch>         Exact Git ref for a new worktree; omit for the project default
    --title <title>                Thread title (idle forks default to "(1) <source title>")
    --permission-mode <mode>       Inherit source by default; accepts accept-edits, auto, full
    --visibility <visibility>      visible (default) or hidden
    --agent-context-seed <text>    Persist agent-only context without a first run
    --file <path>                  CLI-local absolute path, file: URL, or uploaded file path
    --image <path>                 CLI-local absolute path, file: URL, or uploaded image path

  Forks clone the source provider session on the same machine and inherit the
  source conversation in their timeline. --source-seq-end anchors the fork on
  the completed source turn that contains that sequence: the clone and the
  inherited timeline both end with that turn (an anchor on a user message
  branches before it, like editing it). Without it a fork clones the session
  tip and inherits every completed turn. Providers that can only clone a whole
  session accept an anchor only on the source's latest turn. A fork reuses the
  source environment by default. Use --new-environment personal for a fresh
  personal workspace or --new-environment worktree for a fresh worktree on the
  source machine; --environment can select another environment or unmanaged
  path on that machine. A different machine is rejected because the source
  provider session lives on its original machine. Omit --prompt to create an
  idle fork. A visible idle fork without --title is named after its source with
  a numbered prefix: "foo" becomes "(1) foo" and "(1) foo" becomes "(2) foo".
  Forks created with a first prompt get a title from that prompt.

Editing a sent message:

  bb thread edit-message <id> --message "Replacement text"
    --self                              Target the current thread (BB_THREAD_ID)
    --expected-request-sequence <seq>   Select the message and reject a stale target

  Without --expected-request-sequence, the latest eligible message is edited.
  Codex, Claude Code, and Pi threads are supported. The original conversation
  remains unchanged until the provider prepares the replacement history.
  Failed and incomplete turns are eligible. If the thread is running,
  submission stops the current turn and waits for it to settle. It then
  replaces the selected turn and every later turn while retaining workspace
  changes. Unsent queued messages remain in the queue and dispatch after the
  replacement turn when their waits clear. An already-sending queued message
  must finish before the edit can start. Retries of turns replaced by the edit
  are removed from the queue. From an agent thread, the command
  carries `BB_THREAD_ID` so the replacement runs under agent permission policy.
  An edit is refused if removing its history would erase ownership evidence
  shared with another thread. Use bb thread clear <id> to start a new session
  while keeping the history and its ownership evidence.

Listing:

  bb thread list                           List threads
    --project <id>                         Filter by project
    --environment <id>                     Filter by environment
    --machine <id-or-name>                 Filter by the machine the environment is on (alias --host)
    --parent-thread <id>                   Filter by parent thread
    --archived                             Show only archived threads
    --section <id>                         Filter by section
    --unsectioned                          Show only threads outside sections
    --include-hidden                       Include hidden threads

  The table prints ID, Title, Project, and Status. Title uses the thread
  title, then the fallback title from the first prompt, then "-". Long
  titles are cut at 60 characters. Project shows the project name; the
  personal project shows "-". Use --json for the full thread records.

  bb thread search <query> [--limit <1-50>]
                                             Search threads and messages
  bb thread history <id>                   List prompt history

  bb thread count                          Count threads without listing them
    --status <status>                      Count threads in this status: pending, idle, starting, active, stopping, error
    --host <id>                            Count threads whose environment is on this machine
    --provider <id>                        Count threads running on this provider
    --project <id>                         Count threads in this project
    --parent <id|none>                     Count one thread's children, or 'none' for threads with no parent
    --by <dimension>                       Group the count by host, provider, or project

  Counting happens in the database, so use it instead of listing threads and
  counting rows: `bb thread list` pages a bounded window and would miscount.
  Archived, deleted, and hidden threads are excluded. Without --by the command
  prints one number; with --by it prints a count per group (threads with no
  host/provider/project group under "-") followed by the total.

Sections:

  bb thread section list
  bb thread section create <name>
  bb thread section rename <id> <name>
  bb thread section delete <id> [--yes]

Inspecting:

  bb thread context [id]                   Show recorded context usage and available breakdown (--self, --json)
  bb thread show [id]                      Show thread details and pull request status
    --self                                 Target current thread
    --work-status                          Include git working-tree status
    --git-diff                             Include git diff
    --diff-target <type>                   Diff scope: uncommitted, branch_committed, all, commit
    --diff-sha <sha>                       Commit SHA (for --diff-target commit)
    --diff-merge-base <branch>             Override merge-base branch for diff

  Shows pull request status for the attached environment branch when available.

  bb thread log [id]                       Show thread event log
    --self                                 Target current thread
    --format <format>                      Output format: json, minimal, verbose
    --limit <count>                        Max entries: events for json (oldest first, default 100);
                                           user-message turns for minimal/verbose (newest first, default 20, max 100)
    --after-seq <seq>                      Paginate after sequence number (json only)
    --all                                  Print the whole thread, paging through every entry
    --message <seq>                        Print one message
    --context <count>                      With --message, also print this many messages around it (max 20)

  Human formats end with a notice when older history was omitted; --json warns
  on stderr when more events exist beyond the printed page. Human-format --all
  walks a consistent history snapshot and joins paginated group contents.
  Appends stay outside that walk; rerun the command if a history edit invalidates it.

  bb thread output [id]                    Get the final output of a thread
    --self                                 Target current thread

  bb thread wait <id>                      Wait for a thread status or event (defaults to --status idle)
    --status <status>                      Wait for this status
    --event <type>                         Wait for this event type
    --timeout <duration>                   Seconds, or a duration with a unit: 90s, 20m, 4h (default: 1200s / 20 min)
    --poll-interval <duration>             Milliseconds, or a duration with a unit

Opening threads and files in the app:

  In chat, reference a thread as @thread:thr_abc123, substituting its actual ID.
  BB renders the correct project-aware link; do not construct thread URLs manually.
  Pasting a bare thread URL from the current bb origin into a composer turns it
  into the same thread pill when the target resolves. Undo restores the URL;
  paste without formatting (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V) keeps it literal. Links with query
  strings or fragments, quoted/code text, and links to other origins stay literal.
  CLI prompts can use @thread:<id> directly; URL conversion only runs on a user paste.
  Reference one message as @thread:thr_abc123#msg=42, taking the number from
  sourceSeq in `bb thread search --json`. Read it, or a copied message link
  (…/threads/thr_abc123#msg=42), with `bb thread log thr_abc123 --message 42`.

  bb thread open <path>                    Open a file in the current BB thread panel
  bb thread open <thread-id> [path]        Open a thread, optionally with a panel file
    --line <number>                        Line number to focus
    --split <placement>                    right, down, left, top, or replace
  bb thread pane <action> [thread-id]      Maximize, restore, toggle, spotlight, or clear spotlight

  Inside a BB thread, BB_THREAD_ID selects the current thread automatically and
  the thread ID argument is omitted for file-only opens. Outside a BB thread,
  pass the thread ID as the first argument. A thread already open in a pane is focused instead of
  duplicated. Edge placement creates panes through the eighth pane; at eight
  panes, it replaces the focused pane.
  Pane actions broadcast to connected BB app windows and affect the matching
  already-open pane without changing its split tree. Spotlight focuses that
  pane and dims the others; clear-spotlight focuses it and removes split dimming.
  Paths can be thread-relative workspace paths, or absolute paths inside the
  target thread workspace. Absolute paths under BB_THREAD_STORAGE open as
  thread-storage files for the current thread. Use this for Markdown or HTML
  artifacts you create for the user so they open in the BB IDE.

Messaging:

  bb thread tell <id> <message>            Send a follow-up message
  bb thread tell <id> --message-file <path>
                                           Read the message from a file; `-` reads stdin. Use this for
                                           multi-line or Markdown messages: inside double quotes the
                                           shell runs `backticks` and $(...) before bb sees them
    --mode <mode>                          Message mode: steer (default), queue, or auto
    --model <model>                        Model override for this turn
    --reasoning-level <level>              Reasoning level override
    --plan                                 Send the message as the provider's /plan action
    --send-at <when>                       Dispatch at an ISO 8601 timestamp or a duration from now (30s, 10m, 2h, 7d)
    --file <path>                          CLI-local absolute path, file: URL, or uploaded file path
    --image <path>                         CLI-local absolute path, file: URL, or uploaded image path

  Tell steers by default, delivering the message immediately into the active
  turn. Use --mode queue for non-urgent follow-ups that can wait until the agent
  is free; --mode auto steers a live turn and starts a new one on an idle
  thread. Input sent while a turn is starting stays in the queue with
  `waitingOn: turn-starting`; `turn/started` wakes it and steers it into that
  turn. A target that is awaiting user interaction (an open question or
  approval) cannot take a prompt; tell then adds the message to the thread's
  queue and dispatches it once the interaction settles. That outcome is not a
  failure, so do not resend. `--json` reports `delivery` as `sent` or `queued`,
  and a queued answer carries the complete row as `queuedMessage`, including
  its `id`, `waitingOn`, and `sendAt`. A deferred message waits for a thread
  that failed while it was deferred, and delivers when the thread is retried.

  --plan sends the same structured /plan command the composer's plan action
  sends, so the agent proposes a plan for approval before executing (Claude
  Code and Codex threads). Plain "/plan ..." text is not recognized; it reaches
  the provider as literal text. Approve or deny the proposed plan with
  `bb thread interactions`; `bb thread cancel-plan` leaves Plan mode early.
  SDK callers build the same input with
  `createBuiltinPlanCommandTextInput(text)` from `@bb/sdk` and pass it as
  `input` to `threads.spawn` or `threads.send`.

  bb thread stop [id]                      Stop work and release the agent runtime
  bb thread compact [id]                   Request compaction of an idle or errored thread's context
  bb thread clear [id]                     Clear model context for an idle or failed thread
  bb thread cancel-plan [id]               Exit the provider's active Plan mode
  bb thread clear-goal [id]                Clear the provider's active Goal
    --self                                 Target current thread

  `thread compact` enqueues the same structured /compact turn used by the
  composer. Follow the thread timeline for the eventual compaction result.
  `thread clear` keeps the BB thread, workspace, durable event history, and
  sticky execution settings. Its active timeline starts at one visible
  `Context cleared` boundary, and its next prompt starts a fresh provider
  conversation in the same thread.

Ownership:

  bb thread update [id]                    Update thread metadata
    --self                                 Target current thread
    --title <title>                        Set title
    --parent-thread <id>                   Assign to a parent thread
    --clear-parent-thread                  Remove parent assignment
    --section <id>                         Move into a section
    --clear-section                        Remove section assignment
    --model <model>                        Set the sticky model for the next and later turns
    --reasoning-level <level>              Set the sticky reasoning level (provider-dependent)
    --visibility <visibility>              Set visible or hidden

  Clearing a parent inherits the former parent's section unless --section or
  --clear-section is also supplied. Children released by environment archiving
  also inherit their former parent's section.

  Model and reasoning updates stay within the thread's current provider. BB
  validates them against that provider's current model catalog, applies them on
  the next turn, and keeps using them on later turns until changed.

  bb thread read [id]                      Mark read
  bb thread unread [id]                    Mark unread
  bb thread reorder-pinned <id> [--after <id>] [--before <id>]

Interactions:

  bb thread interactions list [id]         List a thread's pending and past interactions
  bb thread interactions show <interaction-id> [id]
                                           Show one interaction (approval details, questions, or a plugin form's data)
  bb thread interactions approve <interaction-id> [id]
                                           Allow a command, file-change, plan, or tool-use approval
  bb thread interactions deny <interaction-id> [id]
                                           Deny an approval
  bb thread interactions grant <interaction-id> [id] --scope turn|session
                                           Grant a permission interaction
  bb thread interactions answer <interaction-id> [id] --choice <questionId=value> --text <questionId=text>
                                           Answer a provider's user question
  bb thread interactions respond <interaction-id> [id] --value '<json>'
                                           Answer a plugin form: a plugin's own request, or a request the agent raised through a provider (kind `<pluginId>/<name>`)
    --self                                 Target current thread (every subcommand)
    --json                                 Machine-readable output (every subcommand)

  `show` prints a plugin form's `Data` so you can shape the `--value` JSON.
  A provider's plugin-defined request cannot be cancelled; stop the thread to
  back out of it.

Queued messages:

  bb thread queue list [<thread-id>] [--wait-holder plugin:<plugin-id>]
  bb thread queue create <thread-id> <message> [--file <path>] [--image <path>]
  bb thread queue update <thread-id> <message-id> <message> [--file <path>] [--image <path>]
  bb thread queue send <thread-id> <message-id> [--mode auto|steer]
  bb thread queue reorder <thread-id> <message-id> [--after <id>] [--before <id>]
  bb thread queue group <thread-id> <boundary-id> --prefix <comma-separated-ids>
  bb thread queue delete <thread-id> <message-id>

  The `Sender` column identifies agent threads and system notices; user messages
  leave it blank. The SDK and `--json` include `initiator` and `senderThreadId`.

  A queued message is one that could not dispatch yet. Every one carries a
  typed reason in its `Waiting on` column: waiting for the current turn to
  finish, for the workspace, for a pending interaction, for a clock (`Send at`),
  or for a plugin that has queued it. `queue list` with no thread id lists every
  queued row in the workspace; `--wait-holder plugin:<plugin-id>` narrows it to
  the rows one plugin is holding.

  Failed rows show their failure reason instead of their previous wait, followed
  by a recovery command: `bb thread queue send <thread-id> <message-id>`.
  Use it to retry immediately, including after automatic retries are exhausted.
  Editing the message does not clear its failure or trigger a retry.

  `queue send` dispatches a row now, bypassing every plugin wait and its own
  schedule — the invariants (a running turn, an unfinished workspace, an
  unanswered interaction) still apply, and a message that hits one simply queues
  again. `--mode steer` uses those same send-now bypasses and re-attempts the row
  as a steer; it does not bypass the invariants, so a provisioning row remains
  queued until the workspace is ready.
  `queue delete` discards it instead. Both are always permitted.

  --send-at takes an ISO 8601 timestamp (2026-08-25T09:00, local without an
  offset) or a duration from now (30s, 10m, 2h, 7d). A time that has already
  passed is rejected, as is a bare date, which has no time of day. Several
  queued rows on one thread are normal: two scheduled sends coexist.

Persisted panel tabs:

  bb thread tabs show <thread-id>
  bb thread tabs set <thread-id> --expected-revision <n> --tabs-json '<json>'

Lifecycle:

  bb thread retry [id]                     Retry the thread's failed turn
    --self                                 Target current thread
    --turn <requestId>                     Retry this turn request id specifically; fails when it is not the thread's failed turn
    --send-at <when>                       Dispatch at an ISO 8601 timestamp or a duration from now (30s, 10m, 2h, 7d)
    --reason <text>                        Why it is being retried, shown on the queued row

  Retry re-submits the failed turn by reference: no duplicated user message in
  the timeline, and an attempt number that increments (2 is the first retry).
  What the provider is sent follows its own acceptance record — an input it
  never accepted is re-sent verbatim, while an accepted turn (already in the
  provider's conversation) is continued with a nudge rather than asked twice.
  With no --turn it retries the most recent turn, the
  one whose failure put the thread in error; --turn asserts which turn you mean
  and fails when the thread has moved on, as does retrying a thread that has not
  failed or a turn that already has a retry queued. Without --send-at the retry
  is attempted now, and may still queue behind a busy thread or a plugin.

  bb thread archive [id]                   Archive a thread (and children/hidden forks)
    --self                                 Archive current thread

  `thread stop` preserves the thread history, metadata, environment, and future
  resume behavior. It stops active work and releases an idle agent runtime.
  The command succeeds when no runtime is loaded. Archive a finished hidden
  worker first, then stop it to release memory promptly. A stop that only
  releases an idle runtime adds no interruption: it leaves the timeline and any
  pending interaction of that thread untouched. An explicit stop wins over work
  that is still running: when the machine still runs a turn for a thread the app
  shows as idle or failed, or a turn starts while the stop is being delivered,
  the stop interrupts that turn and waits for the attempt. If the interrupt
  fails, the thread remains stopping; check `bb thread show <id> --json` before
  treating the stop as confirmed.

  bb thread unarchive [id]                 Unarchive a thread
    --self                                 Unarchive current thread

  bb thread restore-environment [id]       Restore a destroyed workspace
    --self                                 Restore current thread

  Archiving a thread retires its environment, and a managed workspace is removed
  from disk once the provider's grace window passes. Sending to a thread whose
  workspace is gone fails; `restore-environment` asks the environment provider
  to build it again and attaches it, leaving the conversation where it was.
  Each provider decides what that means: a worktree is re-created on the branch
  it held, a project checkout switches back to that branch, and a personal
  workspace cannot be restored. It starts no turn — the thread settles back to
  idle with a live workspace (check `canRestoreEnvironment` on `bb thread show
  --json`). Unarchive the thread first; the command is refused while the thread
  is archived, while its workspace is still there, and when the provider does
  not restore, is gone, or its machine is gone. Uncommitted changes in the
  removed workspace are not recoverable.

  bb thread delete <id>                    Delete permanently
    --yes                                  Skip confirmation

  Deleting a thread removes its record immediately, but provider-owned
  environment cleanup is asynchronous. Use `bb environment show <id>` to
  inspect teardown until the lifecycle reaches destroyed.

Read-only commands require a thread ID or --self where supported.
Mutating thread lifecycle and messaging commands require an explicit ID or --self.

`bb thread context [id]` reads the latest stored context measurement without
starting a provider request. Use `--self` for the current thread and `--json` for
`{ usage: ... }` (`null` when unavailable). Claude Code refreshes the estimated
breakdown after turns and compaction when its SDK supports context inspection.
A later aggregate-only measurement replaces any older breakdown. Other providers
continue to expose their available totals.

Lifecycle ownership:
  spawn and fork accept --lifecycle-owner-thread <id>. SDK arguments use
  lifecycleOwnerThreadId, also returned in thread responses (null if independent).
  The owner must be live; projects, hosts and environments may differ.
  Ownership is immutable. Archive recursively archives/stops dependents; delete
  recursively deletes them after runtime/storage cleanup. Failed cleanup retries
  durably. Unarchive the owner before explicitly restoring a dependent. Stop does
  not cascade. Sidebar parents and ordinary forks retain their existing policies.

Thread storage deletion and orphan cleanup stop processes whose working
directories are inside that storage before removing files, including dev
servers in nested checkouts. On macOS and Linux this uses the same SIGTERM
grace period and SIGKILL fallback as worktree removal. Windows does not
enumerate process working directories.
