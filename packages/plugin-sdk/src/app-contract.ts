   * handoff, exactly like the picker.
   *
   * In the new-thread composer the project is switched first and awaited
   * (attachments are copied to the new project), then the environment and

   * Resolves with the composer's own selection once it has settled: the

   * provider and machine has finished loading, so model, reasoning level and
   * permission mode have reconciled against it. The catalog wait is bounded;
   * if it has not finished after 15 seconds the promise resolves with the
   * selection as it stands. The result carries only the fields this composer
   * has, so a missing key means "no such picker here" and a value that
   * differs from the one passed was reconciled (a reasoning level the model
   * does not support, a service tier the model does not offer, a permission
   * mode above the machine's ceiling, a model the provider does not list). A provider the composer does not list is
   * ignored together with the model and reasoning level meant for it, so the

   * have chosen. `environment` is absent while the composer
   * has no submittable environment; `providerId` and `model` are absent
   * while nothing is selected; `serviceTier` is present only when the
   * selected provider has tiers and one is chosen.
   *
   * Rejects, with a message safe to show to the user, in a composer with no
   * pickers at all (a queued-message editor, a side chat, a plugin surface
   * mounted outside any composer), when the calling surface is no longer
   * active, and when a value is not a known reasoning level or permission
