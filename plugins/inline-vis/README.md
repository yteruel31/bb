# bb-plugin-inline-vis

Builtin plugin for the assistant **message directive** slot
(`app.slots.messageDirective`). When the model emits:

```text
::inline-vis{file="demo.html"}
::inline-vis{file="notes.md"}
```

The omitted `source` defaults to `workspace`; `source="workspace"` is equivalent.
For a read-only artifact in the current thread's storage directory, use:

```text
::inline-vis{source="thread-storage" file="reports/result.html"}
```

Set an optional preview height in pixels with `height`:

```text
::inline-vis{file="demo.html" height="480"}
```

The default is 224px; accepted values are whole numbers from 120 through 1200.

bb replaces that leaf with this plugin's React component, which:

1. Validates the untrusted `source` and `file` attributes.
2. Calls the plugin RPC `preparePreview` with the message `threadId`, source,
   and file path to validate the target and surface clean inline errors.
3. Shows loading / error states on the first read. The last eight successful
   preview results are retained in memory by thread, message, source, and path; remounts
   revalidate without discarding them on temporary read failures. A confirmed missing
   file clears its cached result and shows an error. Every preview includes a header action that
   opens the source file in bb's sidebar viewer, from the workspace or the
   thread's storage directory. For HTML previews that action is a link to the
   rendered page: Cmd-click, Ctrl-click, or middle-click opens it in a browser
   tab (the default browser in desktop bb). The header also collapses or expands the
   preview and remembers that preference on the current client.
4. Points HTML files at bb's existing path-shaped worktree or thread storage
   route inside a sandboxed iframe. Relative sibling assets work, scripts are
   enabled, and normal web loading is allowed. The iframe keeps an opaque
   origin (no `allow-same-origin`) so scripts cannot access the bb page, its
   cookies, or storage. Remote scripts, styles, images, fonts, media, fetches,
   and WebSockets work subject to ordinary browser CORS, mixed-content, and
   remote-server policies.
5. Renders Markdown files with bb's Markdown renderer. HTML is sanitized by the shared renderer.

## Backend security

`preparePreview` narrows `unknown` input immediately (rejects unknown keys and
source values). Workspace previews load the thread with
`include: "environment"` and require its live `path` and `hostId`. Thread
storage previews use `bb.sdk.threads.storageLocation` instead and do not resolve
the workspace. Both sources confine the relative `.html`, `.htm`, `.md`, or
`.markdown` path under the returned root and read it through `bb.sdk.files`
(host-routed). Absolute paths, traversal, unsupported extensions, missing files,
non-UTF-8 content, and files over 5 MiB are rejected. HTML previews then use
bb's existing confined worktree or thread-storage route to serve the document
and relative assets; Markdown previews render the validated content returned by
the RPC.

It ships with bb and is reconciled through the builtin plugin lifecycle. Ship
a supported file in either source, then ask the agent to show it with the
directive (see the bundled `inline-vis` skill).

## Tests

```bash
pnpm exec turbo run test typecheck --filter=bb-plugin-inline-vis
```

Markdown links and images resolve relative to the document's directory in the
selected source. For `::inline-vis{source="thread-storage" file="reports/report.md"}`,
`[Notes](notes.md)` and `![Chart](chart.svg)` refer to files under `reports/`
in that thread's storage. The same rule applies to workspace reports.
