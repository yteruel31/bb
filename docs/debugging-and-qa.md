# Debugging And QA

- `pnpm dev` prints the active frontend URL, server API URL, host daemon port, data dir, and logs dir. Do not assume fixed dev ports.
- `pnpm start:worktree` builds production artifacts and serves the optimized app bundle from the checkout-specific dev server URL, while keeping the same dev data directory and deterministic server/host-daemon ports. It has no Vite dev server or hot reload.
- `pnpm start:worktree-remote` is the trusted-network variant of `pnpm start:worktree`; it binds that server to all IPv4 interfaces.
- `pnpm desktop` packages the Electron app and launches it against the installed data directory, ports and Electron user-data directory, the same targets a released build uses. It therefore shares the single-instance lock with an installed bb: quit that first, or the launch focuses it instead of starting your build.
- `pnpm desktop:worktree` packages and launches it against this checkout's data directory and deterministic ports, the same instance `pnpm start:worktree` uses, so a packaged build never touches `~/.bb` or port 38886. It also points Electron's own user-data directory at `$BB_DATA_DIR/desktop` — window state, storage and the single-instance lock all live there. Without that the build would share `~/Library/Application Support/bb` with an installed bb, fail to take the lock, and quit while the installed app focuses itself, which reads as a successful launch of code that never ran. Override it with `BB_DESKTOP_USER_DATA_DIR`. It refuses to start when the server or host-daemon port is busy, because a stale server there would answer for the build you meant to test. DevTools stay closed unless you set `BB_DESKTOP_OPEN_DEVTOOLS=1`, matching a released build. Both commands always repackage first; Turbo caches everything except electron-builder itself. Signing is left to electron-builder's keychain auto-discovery, so machines without a Developer ID identity produce unsigned artifacts and macOS shows the usual first-launch warning.
- The packaged app defaults to server/frontend `:38886`, host daemon `:38887`, data dir `~/.bb/`, and logs under `~/.bb/logs/`.
- `bb-app` (including `pnpm start`), `bb-server`, and `bb-host-daemon` capture service stdout and stderr directly in `logs/server-stdio.log` and `logs/host-daemon-stdio.log` under the selected data directory. These append across restarts and are separate from rotating application logs. Use `tail -F` on these files for console output and early startup errors; service output is no longer forwarded to the launcher's terminal.
- Connect's `tunnel closed` warnings include the last transport error's original message and code, `connectedDurationMs`, and `lastHeartbeatAckAgeMs`. A null duration means the opening handshake never completed; a null acknowledgement age means no heartbeat acknowledgement arrived on that connection. These warnings appear in the server logs and `<dataDir>/plugins/connect/logs/plugin.log`.
- Entity IDs in URLs (`proj_*`, `thr_*`) are primary keys. Query them directly against the active data dir: `sqlite3 <data>/bb.db "SELECT * FROM threads WHERE id = 'thr_xxx';"`.
- API routes are under `/api/v1/`, for example `GET /api/v1/threads/:id`.
- Use `curl` against the server API to isolate frontend issues from server behavior.
- Use the CLI to inspect state: `pnpm bb thread show <id>`, `pnpm bb project list`, `pnpm bb status`. From source, use `pnpm bb:dev`.

## Reproducing Test Order Failures

CI's test shards shuffle test files and tests within each file. Vitest prints the seed for
runs that execute; unchanged Turbo tasks can still reuse cached results.
Reproduce a failing package with its logged seed:

```bash
pnpm exec turbo run test --filter=@bb/app -- --sequence.shuffle --sequence.seed=4721 --maxWorkers=2
```

For a repository-wide order audit, omit the filter and use `--concurrency=4`
before Turbo's `--` separator. CI caps each Vitest process at two workers so
package concurrency does not multiply into unbounded worker contention.
Use a second seed after
repairing order dependencies. Reset test-owned mock implementations, fixture
arrays, persisted preferences, and databases before each test. Await background
work and close streams, workers, and subprocesses before removing their files or
tearing down their environment. Worker isolation does not restore built-in
process objects or cancel resources that a test leaves running.

## ACP Steer Cancellation Failures

ACP steering cancels the active prompt before submitting the follow-up. If that
prompt returns an error during cancellation, BB marks the session for rebuilding
before the next turn. The replacement process attempts `session/load`; providers
without working session restoration start fresh and report the loss of in-agent
history. The failed turn stays failed, and an unsent steer is not acknowledged as
accepted.

Older Hermes adapters can throw `NoneType.startswith` during cancellation and
leave their internal session marked running. Update Hermes to include
[the null-response fix](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/commit/8f0322da5b82029f3bc4d16fbaa2c986299abfc6)
and [the running-state cleanup](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/commit/bccd45618c16b605822dd179cd0399abdecaf698),
then restart its retained process with `bb thread stop <thread-id>` before sending
a new message. BB's recovery prevents reuse after a cancellation error; it does
not repair the older adapter's failing turn.

## Machine Authentication Cache

Successful verification of an unlimited daemon host key is cached in server
memory for 30 seconds, capped at the key's expiry. The cache holds at most
1,024 entries and retains only token hashes. Hits neither read nor write the
authentication database and do not extend the cache lifetime. The next request
after expiry uses the existing verifier and updates usage timestamps, so
`lastRequest` and `updatedAt` describe the last full verification rather than
every request. A burst of concurrent cold requests can still perform separate
verifications before the first result is cached.

Revocation and reenrollment invalidate that host's cached keys and prevent
already-running verifications from returning or caching invalidated credentials.
Restarting the server discards the cache. Enrollment keys and keys with quotas,
refills, or enabled rate limiting always use the existing verifier. Direct edits
to authentication rows outside the machine-auth service are observed when the
cache expires; QA that changes a warmed key's database fields must account for
that window. Expiry known when caching is enforced on every hit.

## Slow Database Operations

The server logs `Slow DB query` when a prepared statement, `exec` batch, or
complete transaction takes at least 100 ms. `durationMs` measures elapsed time;
`cpuDurationMs` measures CPU time on the calling thread. A large gap indicates
waiting or descheduling, not necessarily inefficient SQL. It does not by itself
distinguish filesystem I/O, lock waits, and scheduler contention.

`operation: "transaction"` includes the callback, commit, and rollback; its SQL
label identifies the transaction mode rather than containing callback SQL.
Statements inside it may also log, so do not add their durations to the
transaction duration. Commit timing matters because SQLite's automatic WAL
checkpoint can perform filesystem writes and synchronization on the server
thread. `operation: "exec"` also covers maintenance batches. SQL string
literals are redacted and parameter values are never logged.

## Pending Question Drafts

Native provider questions and Ask User Question plugin forms save partial
selections, free text, and the current question in browser-local storage under
`bb.question-draft.v1:<threadId>:<interactionId>`. These drafts survive thread
navigation and page reloads on the same browser/device. They are cleared after
successful submission or cancellation and retained if either request fails.
When local storage is unavailable, an in-memory fallback preserves drafts
across navigation until the page reloads. Drafts are not sent to the agent until
submitted, and CLI/SDK answers do not read the browser's draft.
There is no time-based expiry. If an interaction is resolved elsewhere, its
draft can remain in local storage but is never rendered as an active question;
the server's pending interaction list controls that. Clearing browser site data
removes these drafts. Older clients ignore this new storage namespace. Only the
native question form and Ask User Question plugin opt in; secret-request forms
do not use this storage.

## Native Draft Rollback

Migration `0132_thread_drafts` now only adds the temporary `threads.draft`
column. Its original pre-release SQL merged Drafts plugin queue entries into
that column and deleted the held rows and built-in plugin installation. The
original hash remains accepted by `migration-history.ts` for databases that
already ran it; it is not replayed.

Migration `0133_remove_thread_drafts` drops the column without converting its
contents back into queued messages. Databases upgrading through the revised
`0132` retain their existing queue rows and Drafts plugin installation. Databases
that ran the original `0132` lose the stored core draft contents, retaining their
thread rows and any remaining queued messages. The restored built-in plugin is
installed through normal server startup. Reintroducing native drafts requires
a new migration after `0133`.

## Archive Confirmation Counts

`GET /api/v1/threads/:id/child-summary` and `sdk.threads.childSummary` return
`nonDeletedChildCount` for deletion (direct children, including archived rows)
and `unarchivedDescendantCount` for archive confirmation. The latter follows
the same hierarchy, lifecycle-owner, and hidden source-fork edges as
`archive-all`, deduplicates threads, traverses archived intermediaries, and
excludes hidden, already archived, or deleted candidates and the requested root.
Hidden threads still participate in the archive cascade, and visible descendants
beneath hidden threads still count toward confirmation.
The UI adds the root to the displayed total and skips confirmation when no
unarchived descendants remain or the General setting `confirmThreadArchive`
is disabled. The summary is a preview; concurrent changes
can alter the eventual archive result. CLI and SDK archive calls remain
non-interactive.

## File Content Routes

Clients read file bytes through path-shaped GET routes, so relative URLs in
HTML and markdown resolve against the same route:

- `/api/v1/threads/:id/thread-storage/files/:path` reads the thread's storage
  folder.
- `/api/v1/threads/:id/host-files/:absolutePath` and
  `/api/v1/hosts/:id/files/:absolutePath` read the thread environment's host or
  the named host from its filesystem root. The path omits the leading `/`; a
  first segment such as `C:` selects that Windows drive root.
- `/api/v1/environments/:id/files/:path` reads the environment workspace, and
  `/api/v1/environments/:id/revisions/:ref/files/:path` reads `HEAD` or a
  4-40 character hex commit from it.
- `/api/v1/projects/:id/files/:path` and
  `/api/v1/projects/:id/hosts/:hostId/files/:path` read the project's local-path
  source on the primary or named host.

Media elements, HTML iframes, markdown images, and Download links use these
URLs directly. The server resolves the root on every request, so they need no
setup and do not expire.

Plugins that preview an arbitrary host directory instead mint a lease:
`POST /api/v1/files/previews` with `{ hostId?, rootPath, ttlMs? }` returns
`{ baseUrl, expiresAtMs }`, and `GET /api/v1/file-previews/:lease/:path` reads
that root. Minting the same root again returns the same `baseUrl` and extends
its expiry. Leases live in server memory and do not survive a server restart.

File content reads support a single HTTP byte range for media playback, seeking, and
file preview sampling. Responses advertise `Accept-Ranges: bytes`; bounded,
open-ended, and suffix ranges return `206` with `Content-Range` and the selected
bytes. Unsatisfiable ranges return `416` with `Content-Range: bytes */<size>`.
Malformed ranges, unsupported units, and multipart ranges fall back to the full
`200` response. HEAD ignores Range. Revision routes read the file with one
whole-file daemon read, so those responses ignore Range, keep the daemon's
25 MB non-image limit, and revalidate with a strong SHA-256 ETag.

File previews request the first 64 KiB. A complete sample becomes the preview
directly. Otherwise the sample, its MIME type, and the `Content-Range` size
classify the file: images and videos render from the file URL, binaries show
their size and a Download link, and text is fetched in full only when it is at
most 25 MB. The Download link is the file URL with the anchor `download`
attribute, so the browser streams it to disk without the 25 MB limit.

`If-None-Match` revalidation takes precedence over Range. Streamed responses use
weak metadata ETags (`W/"file-<revision>"`), not content SHA-256 hashes. This
avoids reading an entire large file just to validate it. Because the validator
is weak, any `If-Range` header falls back to a full `200` response, including a
matching weak tag or date. All raw file responses carry `Content-Security-Policy:
sandbox allow-scripts`, including SVG and XHTML, so directly opened documents
cannot acquire the app's origin privileges. HTML also carries the no-store
policy, at any size; the app renders an HTML iframe only for files up
to 5 MiB and shows larger HTML as source or, past 25 MB, as a Download.

The server uses `host.read_file_chunk` for a metadata-only probe (`length: 0`),
then reads at most 1 MiB per RPC as the HTTP consumer pulls data. HEAD, `304`,
and `416` responses read no contents. Cancelling or aborting stops subsequent
reads; an already in-flight RPC can finish. Each RPC opens and closes its file
handle, so no remote read session needs cleanup. Offsets and lengths are
validated at the daemon boundary, and paths remain confined to the route's root.

The daemon returns a revision based on device, inode, size, and nanosecond
mtime/ctime. Every content read checks the expected revision before and after
reading from its open descriptor. A mismatch before response headers produces
retryable `409 file_changed`; a change or error after streaming starts aborts
the HTTP body. The server also rejects short/misaligned chunks. This detects
ordinary writes, truncation, and replacement; it is not an immutable filesystem
snapshot or a cryptographic guarantee against changes hidden by filesystem
metadata granularity.

Streamed reads bypass the whole-file size caps (including the 25 MiB
non-image cap); each chunk stays bounded regardless of file size. `host.read_file`
consumers such as `POST /files/read` and revision routes keep their
whole-file limits and SHA-256 validators. `sdk.projects.fileContent` (and
`bb project content`) reads through the project file routes and decides utf8 versus
base64 from the returned bytes. Host-daemon protocol 219 introduced the chunk
RPC; older enrolled daemons cannot serve streamed reads until updated.

## Stale Workspace Claims

Failed thread provisioning immediately requests environment cleanup. If a previous
failure left a claim behind, sends, environment admission, and provider path claims
repair it when they encounter it; restarting the server is not required.

Claims owned by threads that are still starting or stopping remain blocked. A stale
claim on a ready or shared checkout is released locally, preserving the workspace.
A partially created environment retains its claim and is scheduled for the existing
background lifecycle cleanup. Sends report `workspace_busy` with “Workspace cleanup
is pending. Try again shortly.” until removal completes. Provider cleanup is never
awaited by this admission repair, and startup does not scan for abandoned claims.

## Local Dev QA

Run `pnpm dev` from this checkout and keep it running in a terminal. It prints
the checkout-specific URLs, data directory, and logs directory. Stop it with
Ctrl-C. For desktop-only changes, start
`pnpm exec turbo run dev --filter=@bb/desktop` in a second terminal.

Use the Node version in `.nvmrc` (22.19.0). Desktop development requires
Node 22.19 or newer in the Node 22 release line.

A bb connect shared-port URL is a different browser origin from localhost. If
QA through that URL needs the browser-local host daemon, restart the dev app
with the share origin configured after exposing its app port:

```bash
BB_APP_URL=https://<handle>--<app-port>.getbb.app pnpm dev
```

The port remains stable for the checkout, so the existing share continues to
work after the restart. The host daemon intentionally rejects remote origins
that are not configured; otherwise any webpage could drive its local editor
API.

For CLI QA, `pnpm bb:dev` derives this checkout's server and daemon endpoints.
In the test shell, clear inherited endpoint and thread context overrides first
so commands target the dev instance. Keep these changes inside that shell.

Test agents with:

```bash
unset BB_SERVER_URL BB_HOST_DAEMON_PORT BB_THREAD_ID BB_ENVIRONMENT_ID BB_THREAD_STORAGE BB_PROJECT_ID BB_CLI BB_CLI_REEXEC
pnpm bb:dev thread spawn --project proj_personal --provider codex --permission-mode accept-edits --title "Smoke test" --prompt "Reply only with ok." --json
```

## Desktop Browser CDP Prototype

Run the isolated Electron compatibility fixture through Turbo:

```bash
pnpm exec turbo run smoke:browser-cdp --filter=@bb/desktop > /tmp/browser-cdp-smoke.log 2>&1
```

The harness currently requires Linux x64, `xvfb-run`, and network access to
GitHub releases. It downloads checksum-pinned DevBrowser 1.0.0-rc.2 and
agent-browser 0.36.0 into a fresh temporary directory, bundles the fixture,
and drives real `WebContentsView` tabs through the production CDP bridge and
native adapter. It uses a local fixture website and a separate Electron
profile, without starting a BB core or reading an existing BB store.

The command prints its artifact directory, including screenshots, protocol
method traces, and the result summary. Connection credentials are redacted
from the diagnostic output. Desktop startup now registers the native broker;
`bb browser` and `bb.sdk.experimental_desktopBrowsers` expose its public API.
This fixture also exercises service-created hidden automation tabs and leases.
The fixture verifies simultaneous control of a hidden thread and another
thread, in addition to both clients’ main-page workflows. It verifies trusted
snapshot-reference clicks in same-origin and nested iframes, scrolling,
selector clicks in a cross-origin iframe with a native child CDP session,
and pointer input in a hidden thread’s iframe. Site isolation is enabled
for the fixture. Unmodified RC2 omits cross-origin iframe contents from
snapshots; use the local-build mode below for the implemented cross-origin
ref support. Popup control remains untested.

To validate a modified DevBrowser build, run:

```bash
pnpm exec turbo run smoke:browser-cdp --filter=@bb/desktop -- --dev-browser /absolute/path/to/dev-browser > /tmp/browser-cdp-local-smoke.log 2>&1
```

The `--dev-browser` option copies that binary into the artifact directory,
records its SHA256 and local-build provenance, and adds required cross-origin
snapshot-ref tests. These reject old refs after same-URL reloads, origin
changes, frame removal, and parent navigation, even after a fresh snapshot
has allocated new refs. It checks both the stale-ref error and absence of
click side effects. Frame origin changes are driven through the parent
iframe’s `src`: Puppeteer’s `Frame.goto()` can lose its session on a renderer
swap, including in ordinary Chrome. The default command continues to test the unmodified
release. Run the task with `-- --help` for usage.

The native adapter uses one viewport capture before pointer input following
attachment or navigation, so input does not race the renderer’s readiness.
Concurrent pointer commands share that capture and preserve their order.
Attachment enables Chromium focus emulation and temporarily disables background
throttling, restoring the original throttling state on detach. While a CDP
screenshot is pending, bounded native captures request frames without revealing
the view; they stop at completion or a five-second deadline. The original CDP
screenshot parameters are preserved.
The image is discarded locally; pending input is rejected if navigation
or a replacement controller invalidates it. A failed capture can be retried,
and detaching one virtual session cancels its pending input while other
sessions remain usable.

After library cleanup and writing the result, the runner allows five seconds
for Electron to quit. If it remains alive, the runner terminates its fixture
process group and records `forcedExit: true`. A successful smoke command with
that flag proves the listed browser checks, not graceful Electron shutdown.

## Desktop Browser Broker Integration

```bash
pnpm exec turbo run smoke:browser-broker --filter=@bb/desktop -- --dev-browser /absolute/path/to/dev-browser > /tmp/browser-broker-smoke.log 2>&1
```

This isolated fixture uses an in-memory migrated test server, the actual SDK
and CLI, an authenticated host broker, the desktop broker client, and real
Electron tabs. The test harness supplies the server-to-host RPC responder;
it does not start a full enrolled daemon or prove remote-machine transport.
It verifies private connection-file permissions, ownership, browser input,
capture, revocation, and connection generations. The default downloads the
checksum-pinned release; the optional binary path records local provenance.
No existing BB store or browser profile is used.

## Record Provider Bridge Traffic

Export `BB_PROVIDER_BRIDGE_RECORD_DIR` before you start the dev app and every
provider bridge records its runtime and provider wires as NDJSON:

```bash
BB_PROVIDER_BRIDGE_RECORD_DIR=$HOME/.bb/provider-recordings/raw pnpm dev
```

In a second terminal, run:

```bash
unset BB_SERVER_URL BB_HOST_DAEMON_PORT BB_THREAD_ID BB_ENVIRONMENT_ID BB_THREAD_STORAGE BB_PROJECT_ID BB_CLI BB_CLI_REEXEC
pnpm bb:dev thread spawn --project proj_personal --provider codex --prompt "Run git status." --json
ls ~/.bb/provider-recordings/raw/codex/
```

The layout is `<dir>/<providerId>/<threadId>/<direction>.ndjson`, plus a
`_process` scope for lines that belong to no thread. See
[provider-bridge-protocol.md](provider-bridge-protocol.md), "Record mode",
for the entry format. Raw recordings can contain secrets and absolute paths.
Run `node scripts/provider-recordings/redact.mjs <raw-dir> <out-dir>` before
you share one, and never commit a raw recording.

To compare two checkouts' bridges on the committed recordings, run
`pnpm parity --old <checkout> --new . [--provider <id>] [--cell <name>]`.
Each leg replays every cell through its own bridge, assembler, and timeline
projection; the run prints a PASS/FAIL line per cell with event and row
counts and exits non-zero on any diff outside
`packages/provider-bridge-protocol/recordings/parity-allowlist.json`.

## Performance Fixture Database

Use `pnpm seed:perf` to fill a dev database with a large, realistic fixture:
many projects, ~1,200 threads, and ~400k event rows with production-like
payloads. Use it to reproduce performance problems that only appear at scale.

- Start the dev app once first (`pnpm dev`), then stop it and
  seed. The fixture then attaches to the real local host, so agents still run.
- By default the command seeds this checkout's dev data dir. Pass
  `--data-dir <path>` for another target. The command refuses to touch `~/.bb`.
- Scale flags: `--projects`, `--threads`, `--events`, `--seed`. `--reset`
  deletes the database file first. Without `--reset` the fixture appends.
- Example: `pnpm seed:perf -- --reset --events 400000`.

## Provider Corpus

The provider corpus is a private set of real production threads (307 threads,
330,626 event rows, extracted from a personal `~/.bb/bb.db`). It is the
regression oracle for the provider-plugin migration: every layer must project
the same rows and build timelines at the same speed. The corpus contains real
prompts, code, and paths, so it is **never committed**; `.gitignore` blocks
every `provider-corpus/` directory except the in-repo harness and scripts.

- Location: `~/.bb/provider-corpus/` by default. Tests read it through
  `BB_PROVIDER_CORPUS_DIR` and skip when the variable is unset or the directory
  has no `manifest.json`, so CI and fresh checkouts stay green.
- Layout: `manifest.json` (thread selection and reasons), `profile.json`,
  `threads/<provider>/<threadId>/{meta.json,events.ndjson}`, and the generated
  `snapshots/` directory described below.
- Reader: `@bb/test-helpers` exports `corpusAvailable()`,
  `listCorpusThreads({ provider?, reasons? })`, and `loadCorpusThread(id)`.
  Event rows decode through the same `parseStoredThreadEvent` the server uses.

Gates under `apps/server/test/provider-corpus/`:

- `row-snapshots.test.ts` loads each thread into in-memory SQLite and projects
  every timeline page the way `GET /threads/:id/timeline` does (default and
  nested variants), then compares the rows with
  `snapshots/rows/<provider>/<threadId>.json`.
- `timeline-perf.test.ts` measures the 10 largest threads per provider (latest
  page and full page walk, five builds each, calibrated against a synthetic
  thread built in the same run) and compares with `snapshots/perf-baseline.json`.
  The CI micro-benchmark in the same file needs no corpus. Each sample clears
  the decoded-event cache and the latest-page selection memo, so the gate keeps
  measuring cold builds.
- `timeline-streaming-memo.test.ts` marks each thread active, appends streaming
  rows to its latest turn tick by tick (plus one late output delta for the
  previous root turn), and requires every latest-page build to equal a build on
  a fresh connection with empty caches. It prints how many builds reused the
  selection memo and the warm and cold tick build times.

Run them:

```bash
scripts/provider-corpus/snapshot-rows.sh compare   # default mode, fails on diffs
scripts/provider-corpus/snapshot-rows.sh write     # refresh the baseline
```

The script wraps `pnpm exec turbo run test:provider-corpus --filter=@bb/server`
with `BB_PROVIDER_CORPUS_SNAPSHOT=write|compare`. Turbo strips undeclared
variables, so use that task (not the package `test` task) when you set the
corpus variables. Each run writes `snapshots/rows-last-run.json` and
`snapshots/perf-last-run.md` with totals and the perf table.

Compare mode fails on any row diff that `snapshots/allowlist.json` does not
cover. An entry names a scope, a path, and the PR that made the change:

```json
[
  {
    "threadId": "thr_abc123",
    "path": "/variants/*/pages/*/rows/*/output",
    "pr": "#1234",
    "reason": "…"
  },
  {
    "provider": "codex",
    "path": "/variants/default/pages/**/planSteps",
    "pr": "#1235",
    "reason": "…"
  },
  { "*": true, "path": "/variants/**/maxSeq", "pr": "#1236", "reason": "…" }
]
```

`path` is a JSON pointer over the snapshot, or a glob where `*` matches one
segment and `**` any number. The run prints the entries it used; an entry that
covers nothing fails the run because it is stale.

`snapshots/rows` is the baseline minted on `main` and shared by every
workstream, so never run `write` against it from a feature branch. A PR that
intentionally changes rows carries its own allowlist in the repository
(`apps/server/test/provider-corpus/allowlists/<ws>.json`, same schema, merged
after the shared file) and compares with
`BB_PROVIDER_CORPUS_ALLOWLIST=<that file>`. A snapshot of the branch's own
rows goes to a shadow directory: `BB_PROVIDER_CORPUS_SNAPSHOT_DIR=<dir>`
redirects both `write` and `compare`. Re-mint `snapshots/rows` from `main`
after such a PR merges and delete the allowlist file it carried.

A pointer allowlist cannot describe a change that adds or removes rows: every
later sibling shifts and the diff reports the whole turn. For such a change,
carry a row-class file instead
(`apps/server/test/provider-corpus/allowlists/<ws>-row-classes.json`) and set
`BB_PROVIDER_CORPUS_ROW_CLASSES=<that file>` on the compare run. The gate then
matches rows by identity (`callId`, `itemId`, `interactionId`, turn id, or row
id), buckets every change into the first class whose matcher fits, and fails
on a change no class claims or an entry that claims nothing (judged per
entry, so a dead matcher cannot hide behind a sibling with the same name). A
class names a `reason` and one matcher: `added`, `removed`, `moved` (the row left one
nesting level for another), `resegmented` (a turn shows a different number of
visible segments), `reshaped` (`from`/`to` kinds, optionally the other
`fields` the reshape may touch), or `changed` with the `fields` it may touch;
each narrows by `kind`, `workKind`, `role`, and `nested`. Turn bounds that follow a changed child fall into the built-in
`container-bounds` class. The run prints the count per class and records them
in `rows-last-run.json`. To iterate on the classes without re-projecting the
corpus, mint the branch's rows once into a shadow directory and classify the
two directories offline:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx scripts/provider-corpus/classify-row-diff.ts \
  ~/.bb/provider-corpus/snapshots/rows ~/.bb/provider-corpus/snapshots/rows.<ws> \
  --classes apps/server/test/provider-corpus/allowlists/<ws>-row-classes.json --verbose
```

Perf compare mode passes when each thread's normalized cost is within 10% of
the baseline (or within 5 ms of intrinsic cost for the small latest-page
builds) and the median event size is within 15%. The normalized cost is the
minimum build time over five samples divided by the minimum time of a fixed
CPU workload (JSON codec and sorting over a deterministic document) run once
per sample right before the builds. The workload shares no code with the
timeline, so a uniform timeline regression still moves the ratio, while
machine speed and steady load cancel. Each thread gets up to three attempts so
a burst of load does not fail the run (write mode keeps the median attempt);
raw p50/p95 are printed for information. The
baseline records the gate settings and compare mode refuses a baseline
written with different ones. Run the gate on a machine whose load average is
below its core count: when the machine is oversubscribed the table header
says so and even paired ratios drift by 10–20%.

## Local Cloud

Run the Cloud dashboard, the Connect worker, and the AI gateway against one
local D1 database:

```bash
pnpm cloud:dev
```

The command applies migrations and prints the dashboard URL. Create a local
email/password account, claim a handle, create a pairing code, and run the
displayed `bb account login --code` command against a bb started with
`pnpm dev` (`bb connect --code` does the same and also turns remote access
back on). A browser sign-in started with
`bb account login` opens `<local origin>/link?code=…` on the same origin. The
same worktree-specific local origin serves the dashboard at `bb.localhost`,
sends `bb.localhost/api/ai/*` to the AI gateway worker, and routes
`<handle>.bb.localhost` through the Connect worker. Email/password auth
is enabled only for this loopback workflow; production remains GitHub-only.
`pnpm dev` automatically sets `BB_DEV_CONNECT_BASE_URL` to that worktree's
local Cloud origin. While the bb is signed out, Settings → bb account and
Settings → Installed plugins → Connect therefore sign in against the local
Cloud, and a pasted code redeems locally. An explicit `--base-url ...` (or
`bb connect --server ...`) still wins, so the dev bb can still sign in to
getbb.app.
Local machine enrollment follows the same origin: local `http:` server URLs
produce `ws:` machine tunnels and `http:` share URLs, while non-local machine
enrollment remains HTTPS-only.

The AI gateway answers `503 unavailable` until an OpenRouter key is present.
Export `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the shell before `pnpm cloud:dev` to pass it
through to the local worker; the startup banner says which mode is active.
To exercise the whole chain without OpenRouter, export
`BB_CLOUD_DEV_AI_UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` (for example `http://127.0.0.1:4599/api/v1`)
pointing at a local OpenAI-compatible fake, plus any non-empty
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
The production gateway gets the key from the repository's `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
Actions secret, which `deploy-ai-gateway.yml` uploads with each deploy. Set the
staging key with `wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY --env staging` from
`apps/ai-gateway`. Use a dedicated OpenRouter key with account-wide zero data
retention and a daily credit limit.

Ctrl-C stops the local services. Local D1 state is kept under
`.wrangler/cloud-dev`.

To test a source bb against the deployed staging Cloud instead, start it with
`pnpm dev --staging`. bb account and Connect then sign in, redeem codes, open
tunnels, and call the AI gateway at `https://vibecodethis.site`; no
`pnpm cloud:dev` is needed. The flag only changes the default origin, so a
dev data dir already signed in elsewhere keeps its account until
`bb account logout`.

## Provider-literal ratchet (G1)

`node scripts/check-provider-literal-ratchet.mjs` counts provider-_id_ literals
(`"codex"`, `"claude-code"`, `"acp-…"`, `providerId === "…"`, `isAcpProviderId`, …)
in core (everything outside `plugins/provider-*` and `examples/`) and compares a
per-file count against `scripts/provider-literal-baseline.json`. The count may
only go down. Adding a provider-id branch to core fails CI. When you remove
literals, regenerate the baseline with `--write` and commit it so the reduction
is recorded. `--list` prints every hit. When the baseline reaches zero, delete
it and the guard. This is guardrail G1 of the provider-plugin migration
(the provider-plugin API design (docs/provider-plugin-api.md, added by the v3 contract PR; overview at https://get-bb.github.io/reports/design/provider-plugin-api.html)).

## Linux AppImage Node runtime

The AppImage launcher probes user namespaces and injects `--no-sandbox` when
they are unavailable. Electron running as Node rejects that Chromium flag.
The owned runtime supplies it after Node's `--` argument separator: AppRun sees
the explicit flag and skips injection, while Node treats it as a script
argument. The bridge subprocess receives only its script path. The AppImage
lifecycle smoke exercises this launch and verifies that its runtime mount
survives closing the GUI.

## Prepared Worktree Restarts

`pnpm start` and `pnpm start:worktree` always run Turbo-backed preparation before
launching. Turbo decides which tasks need rebuilding and restores unchanged
artifacts from cache. Native modules are checked and repaired when necessary.
Worktree startup retains stable checkout-specific data, ports, telemetry, and
runtime policy.

Use `pnpm start --dryrun` or `pnpm start:worktree --dryrun` ahead of startup.
The same command selects its normal dotenv settings and runtime policy, prepares
artifacts through Turbo, prints resolved ports, bind host, data/config/log paths
and runtime entrypoints as JSON, then exits. It does not launch services, migrate
instance data or require ports to be free. Dry runs still write build outputs and
may repair native modules. Install dependencies with
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` beforehand when needed.

Build tasks clean their own outputs when they run. Startup does not clear output
directories before invoking Turbo. Cache hits use Turbo's normal restoration
behavior, which restores cached files but can leave extra files from an earlier
build. There is no custom preparation receipt or whole-checkout hashing pass.
Do not prepare concurrently with another preparation or against build files
still served by a live instance.

Preparation writes build outputs in the checkout. If the previous process serves
those same paths, preparation can change files it reads: this is not an atomic
release switch. Use a separate staging checkout to warm the shared Turbo cache
while the old instance runs, then stop the verified instance, update/install and
prepare its stable checkout, and launch. For an already stopped, fully prepared
checkout, normal startup restores its artifacts through Turbo cache hits. Moving
the serving checkout changes the default instance data and ports; do not move it as a restart shortcut.

The repo-level programmatic entry point is `prepareRuntime()` in
`scripts/start-bb.mjs`. This is a source-maintenance helper, not a new
installed `bb` command or public plugin SDK API. The source launcher accepts `--dryrun` for preparation and configuration preview.
`pnpm start` keeps its existing production dotenv and packaged runtime policy.

Turbo output ownership is separate: server `build` owns `apps/server/dist`,
`@bb/bundled-plugins#build` assembles `packages/bundled-plugins/dist` from 33 independently
cached `<plugin-package>#prepare:bundled` tasks. Each plugin declares
`@bb/plugin-build` as a workspace dev dependency and runs
`bb-plugin-build prepare-bundled` from its own directory. Turbo builds the shared
executable through `^build` before preparation. The executable bundles the plugin
without importing server policy or requiring a TypeScript loader. Each plugin
task owns only its
`plugins/<name>/.bundled-runtime` directory; regular plugin builds still own
`plugins/<name>/dist`. Changing one plugin rebuilds its preparation and final
assembly, while unchanged plugins restore from cache. Shared SDK/toolchain
changes deliberately invalidate every plugin. The assembly package declares its
plugin dependencies in `package.json`; Turbo
uses `^prepare:bundled` to build them. Adding a bundled plugin requires its
package script and workspace dependency, checked against the runtime registry
by the startup test suite. Shared sources are hashed through workspace `topo`
dependencies rather than repository-wide source globs.
Bundled preparation uses temporary source copies and never writes the regular
plugin `dist` directories. `bb-app#build` depends on and
copies prepared plugins into its own package output. The plugin task hashes
plugin sources, manifests, branding, skills, staging scripts/entries, lockfile,
patches, workspace configuration, SDK/build-tool sources and versions, and theme;
generated modules and SDK artifacts arrive through explicit dependency edges.
The source preparation runner supplies `BB_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` with Node, OS, and
architecture to partition Turbo cache entries; callers should use the runner
rather than set this internal build identity themselves.

Built source servers resolve plugins and the bundled marketplace from
`packages/bundled-plugins/dist` before looking beside the server bundle.
This prevents legacy `apps/server/dist/builtin-plugins` artifacts left by a
Turbo cache restore from overriding newly prepared plugins. Installed packages
use their shipped `server/dist/builtin-plugins` directory. Built-in plugins
update with the server; users do not update them separately.

## Reviewing UI Code Splits

See [UI code splitting](ui-code-splitting.md) for the app's `defineSplit`
contract, explicit preload scopes, bundle-boundary guards, and parallel worker
handoff requirements. Use an isolated production build with browser request
interception to review loading and failure states and verify cold-download
behavior. Keep temporary review stories and fixtures out of the final diff.

## Pull Request Status And Daemon Compatibility

Host-daemon protocol 228 makes `thread.storage.delete` and recursive directory
removal through `host.remove_path` stop processes with working directories
inside the target before deleting files. The latter also covers orphaned
thread storage cleanup and CLI/SDK file removal. This uses the worktree removal
process sweep on macOS and Linux; Windows does not enumerate process working
directories. Older daemons must update to receive these cleanup semantics.

Host-daemon protocol 226 opens the service tier: `serviceTier` in execution
options is any non-empty tier id instead of `fast` or `default`, and
`model/list` entries may carry `supportedServiceTiers`. A daemon on 225 rejects
tier ids other than `fast` and `default`.

Host-daemon protocol 224 removes wire members that neither side used: the
`host.file_metadata` command, the `disallowedTools` runtime-context field, the
`cwd` and `requirement` fields on provider installation and usage commands, the
`appliedAs` field of `turn.submit` results, and the `serviceManager` field of
`server_move.inspect` results.

Host-daemon protocol 223 upgrades Zod to 4.6.5. String length constraints now
count Unicode code points rather than UTF-16 code units. For example, a
controller label containing 256 emoji passes the 256-character limit; 257
emoji fails. Daemons on protocol 222 must update before reconnecting so the
server and daemon enforce the same validation behavior.

Host-daemon protocol 222 adds required `autoMerge` and nullable `inMergeQueue`
fields to `workspace.pull_request` results. A null queue value means the
separate GitHub GraphQL lookup was unavailable; other PR data remains usable.
The server checks protocol compatibility before parsing session payloads.
A daemon still on 221 is rejected with `protocol_version_mismatch` and cannot
serve workspace RPCs until it updates and reconnects. Auto-update-enabled
older daemons install the server's matching bb-app artifact; disabled or failed
updates leave the machine disconnected until a manual update succeeds. This
is an intentional version gate, not backward-compatible field defaulting.

## Opt-in server performance diagnostics

Run `pnpm start --perf-diagnostics` (or `pnpm start:worktree --perf-diagnostics`)
when investigating slowness. `bb-app --perf-diagnostics` uses the same launcher
option. The equivalent startup setting is `BB_PERF_DIAGNOSTICS=1`; it defaults
to false and requires a server restart. Remove the flag/setting and restart to
turn it off. This does not enable profiling for the daemon or other servers.

When both gates are on, the mode logs database operations taking at least 25 ms, API requests taking
at least 100 ms, and event-loop stalls of at least 100 ms. Every five seconds,
`Server performance sample` records process and main-thread CPU time, loop
utilization/delay, GC duration/count/max, and memory. CPU values are totals for
that interval, not attribution to an individual request. GC callbacks can be
delayed by a blocked loop. These measurements distinguish CPU pressure from
elapsed-time stalls but do not prove a particular OS scheduling or I/O cause.

Continuous V8 CPU sampling at 1 ms writes a `.cpuprofile` every 30 seconds to
`$BB_DATA_DIR/logs/performance/`. Profiles are retained for up to 12 hours with a total cap of 1 GB
(1,000,000,000 bytes), deleting oldest captures first when either limit is
reached. Each file is limited to 12 MiB (oversized captures are discarded).
Cleanup runs when collection starts and before each save, including captures
from previous sessions. Space for the pending file is reserved inside the
total cap. Turning collection off leaves saved captures until collection
starts again; their age does not reset. Graceful
shutdown saves the partial window; a crash can lose the current window.
`Server CPU profile saved` logs its path, PID, and UTC start/end times. Copy
relevant files before age or size retention removes them. Load a profile in Chrome
DevTools' JavaScript profiler to inspect sampled stacks. No inspector network
port is opened. Save records explicitly report `sampleTimeBasis: elapsed` and
`nativeFramesMayIncludeWaiting: true`. Sampling can miss short calls and does not identify native
I/O waits precisely.

Profiling, serialization, and extra logging add overhead, so leave this off
for routine operation. Files use private permissions and can contain local
paths and function names; inspect before sharing. Existing logs retain their
normal rotation policy. No request bodies or SQL bindings are added by this
mode. A capture failure is logged and disables CPU capture for that process;
summary logging continues. Profiles already saved remain after disabling it.

Diagnostics require **both** startup permission (`--perf-diagnostics` or
`BB_PERF_DIAGNOSTICS=1`) and the **Server performance diagnostics** toggle in
Settings → Experiments. The toggle is only shown when startup permission is present; a saved experiment value does not make it visible. The experiment defaults to off. Use
`bb settings experiment performanceDiagnostics true` to enable it, or `false`
to stop it; SDK clients use the existing experiments update endpoint. The
experiment takes effect live on that server. Without startup permission it
cannot start collection. Turning it off restores normal logging thresholds,
stops the sampler and flushes the in-flight profile; existing files remain.
The launch flag only grants permission and still requires a restart to change.

### Diagnose a captured stall

1. Record the affected request path and approximate UTC time. Find its
   `Slow API request` and nearby `Event loop stalled` records. For timelines,
   match the thread ID to `Thread timeline build blocked the event loop` and
   inspect the stage timings. `inFlightWorkAtObservation` can name an unrelated asynchronous
   long poll; it is not proof of what blocked the loop. Compare `longestSynchronousWork`
   and its `longestSynchronousWorkWallMs` / `longestSynchronousWorkCpuMs`
   measurements with the profile stacks instead.
2. Find the `Server CPU profile saved` interval covering that time and PID.
   Copy the file before rotation overwrites it. In the JavaScript profiler,
   select the affected time window and inspect the bottom-up view and caller
   stack. Packaged captures name functions and bundled JavaScript locations;
   match function names against the exact source revision used to build it.
3. Compare sampled stacks with `mainThreadCpuMs`, GC totals and SQL
   `cpuDurationMs`. A native SQLite call may appear throughout an elapsed wait
   without consuming equivalent CPU. A slow SQL operation with very little
   CPU indicates waiting, but does not identify the lock owner or prove disk
   I/O. Interval CPU totals include other requests and background work.
4. Repeat with a small control workload. Expected long polls can generate
   slow-request records without blocking the event loop; require corroborating
   loop delay, stage timings or sampled execution before calling them stalls.
