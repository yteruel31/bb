# Configuration

Launcher status output is plain when stdout is redirected, including in CI.
Set `FORCE_COLOR=1` to request color or `NO_COLOR=1` to disable it; `NO_COLOR`
takes precedence. In-place progress updates require a stdout TTY.

The packaged `npx bb-app` flow stores persistent package settings under
`~/.bb/config.json`, provider environment values under `~/.bb/env.json`, and
client SSH target mappings under `~/.bb/client.json`.

Use `bb-app config` for non-secret bb settings:

```bash
npx bb-app config set BB_APP_URL https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net
npx bb-app config list
npx bb-app config unset BB_APP_URL
npx bb-app config refresh
```

BB accepts request hosts that are `localhost`, IP addresses (including LAN and
Tailscale IPs), or the hostname in `BB_APP_URL`. For a custom DNS name or reverse
proxy, set `npx bb-app config set BB_APP_URL https://bb.example.com` before
connecting, including from the CLI or SDK. A matching `Host` and `Origin`, or
`X-Forwarded-Host`, cannot authorize an unconfigured DNS name. A proxy can
preserve the configured host or forward to localhost. BB Connect rewrites
requests to the local server address and needs no additional configuration.
`BB_SERVER_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` remains supported for direct remote access.

Use `bb-app env` for provider credentials and provider-specific environment:

```bash
npx bb-app env set OPENAI_API_KEY <key>
npx bb-app env list
npx bb-app env unset OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Repository worktree hooks

Commit `.bb-env-setup.sh` when a managed worktree needs repository setup.
Commit `.bb-env-teardown.sh` when bb must release external resources before it
removes that worktree. See [Worktrees, setup scripts, and teardown
scripts](worktrees.md) for the lifecycle, environment, timeout, and failure
contracts.

## Linux machine installer

The machine installer normally installs a persistent systemd user service. If
the current user's bus is unavailable, it retries using the runtime path from
`loginctl`. On a systemd host it then fails before enrolling if the bus still
cannot be reached. In containers and on machines without systemd as init, it
runs a detached daemon instead. Set
`BB_INSTALL_SKIP_SERVICE=1` on the installer command only when running without
a service is intentional. No service starts the daemon after a reboot. The
temporary daemon used for a first join is not supervised; a previously joined
daemon started by the installer is supervised while its launcher runs.

`bb-app config list` shows non-secret values. `bb-app env list` redacts every
value and only shows whether a key is set.

The Add machine installer may also store a `machineCredential` and its
`connectMachineId` beside `serverUrl` in `config.json`. The credential is a
secret managed by bb connect: do not copy, edit, or commit it. Both fields are
intentionally omitted from `bb-app config list`. At runtime bb-app passes
`machineCredential` to the standalone host daemon through `BB_SERVER_HEADERS`,
and the daemon and its bundled `bb` CLI send it to the server as the
`x-bb-connect-machine` header; `connectMachineId` is only stored. These are
installer-managed transport details, not user configuration knobs; re-add the
machine instead of setting them by hand.

Use `bb-app client ssh-target` to let a local helper open files from a remote
bb server in local editors. The SSH target is the value that works after
`ssh`, such as `devbox`, `user@devbox`, or a `Host` entry from `~/.ssh/config`:

```bash
npx bb-app client ssh-target set https://bb.example.test devbox --host-id host_abc
npx bb-app client ssh-target list
npx bb-app client ssh-target remove https://bb.example.test --host-id host_abc
```

Use `--host-id` when the server has more than one machine; copy the ID from
`bb machine list`. Omit it to preserve the single-machine auto-selection for
`set`, or to remove every mapping for that server with `remove`.

## Precedence

Configuration is resolved in this order:

1. Explicit launcher flags, such as `--data-dir`, `--server-port`, or
   `--server-bind-host`.
2. Persistent `bb-app config`, `bb-app env`, and client values.
3. Ambient shell environment.
4. Built-in defaults.

For the packaged app, prefer `bb-app config`, `bb-app env`, and launcher flags
over shell variables. The environment remains the internal and deployment
substrate, and source-development commands still load `.env` files.

For source development, `pnpm dev` automatically injects
`BB_DEV_CONNECT_BASE_URL=http://bb.localhost:<worktree-cloud-port>`;
`pnpm dev --staging` injects `https://vibecodethis.site` instead. The bb
account plugin accepts only those origins, only when `NODE_ENV=development`,
and uses the value as the sign-in default; the Connect plugin
uses it for its dashboard link while signed out. Explicit
`bb account login --base-url ...`, `bb connect --server ...`, or
`--base-url ...` targets take precedence but accept only `https://getbb.app`
and `https://vibecodethis.site` (plus `http://bb.localhost:<port>` when
`NODE_ENV=development`), and packaged/production bb keeps the
`https://getbb.app` default. This value is launcher-managed, not a
`bb-app config` setting.

After `bb-app config` writes `~/.bb/config.json` or `bb-app env` writes
`~/.bb/env.json`, it asks the running local server to reload. If bb is not
running, the new values apply on the next start. If you edit either file by
hand, run `npx bb-app config refresh` to apply the files to a running server.

The live reload applies the `BB_APP_URL` config key and provider env values. If
`BB_APP_URL` is stored with `bb-app env` instead, it is startup-only; use
`bb-app config` when you need a live change.

`BB_LOG_LEVEL` is the startup-only `bb-app config` key. The complete current
set of startup-only server or launcher env entries is:

- `BB_APP_SURFACE`, `BB_APP_URL`, `BB_DATA_DIR`, `BB_DEV_APP_PORT`, and
  `BB_EXTERNAL_URL`
- `BB_HOST_DAEMON_PORT` and `BB_INHERITED_SKILLS_ROOTS`
- `BB_LOG_LEVEL`, `BB_MANAGED_DEV_BUILTIN_PLUGIN_HOT_RELOAD`,
  `BB_MARKETPLACE_URL`, `BB_POSTHOG_API_KEY`, and `BB_TELEMETRY`
- `BB_SERVER_BIND_HOST`, `BB_SERVER_PORT`, and all `BB_FF_*` feature flags

Setting or unsetting one still runs the reload for any other pending changes,
but the running processes keep their current values. Apply it with a full
launcher restart (`bb-app stop && bb-app start`) or by restarting the desktop
app. In particular, changing or unsetting `BB_SERVER_BIND_HOST` does not close
an existing `0.0.0.0` listener until that restart.

`bb-app config refresh` also notes any startup-only keys currently present in
`config.json` or `env.json`; those values apply on the next full restart.

When targeting a non-default running instance, pass the same `--data-dir` and
`--server-port` to `bb-app config` or `bb-app env` commands so they write the
right file and refresh the right server.

## Stopping A Running bb

A running `bb-app start` writes `<dataDir>/bb-app-runtime.json` and removes the
file when it exits. The file records the launcher process id, the server URL,
the version, the start time, and how bb was started. Do not edit it.

Two things read that file:

- `npx bb-app stop` stops the bb that owns the data directory. Pass the same
  `--data-dir` you started with when it is not the default `~/.bb/`.
- The macOS desktop app asks before it uses a bb it did not start, and offers to
  stop that copy for you.

Both confirm that the recorded process really is a bb launcher before they
signal it, so a stale file left by a crash cannot stop an unrelated process.

## In-App Updates

In-app updates are off unless you start bb with `--in-app-updates`:
`npx bb-app start --in-app-updates` (or a global `bb-app`), or
`pnpm start --in-app-updates` from a source checkout. bb then runs under a small
update shim, so Settings → Updates and `bb updates app apply` can update bb
without a terminal. Without the flag, bb starts as before and Settings → Updates
shows the npm upgrade command for release installs. Source checkouts show their
Git revision, or a labeled build version when unavailable, and are never compared
with npm releases. Without the update shim, no freshness indicator is shown.
Failed checks report “Latest unknown”; release checks can be retried in the UI,
with `sdk.system.version({ force: true })`, or by rerunning `bb updates`.
`GET /api/v1/system/version` and `sdk.system.version()` expose nullable
`installKind` (`desktop`, `npm`, or `source`) and `currentCommit` fields.

- **npm installs** download the new release into
  `<dataDir>/app-versions/<version>/` while bb keeps running, then restart into
  it. The shim runs whichever is newer, that install or the `npx` copy you
  launched; pass `--bundled` to run the launched copy regardless. bb keeps the
  running and previous versions and deletes older ones. Stable installs follow
  the `latest` dist-tag and nightly builds follow `nightly`.
- **Source checkouts** update only from a clean `main` that fast-forwards to
  `origin/main`. bb stops, fast-forwards, runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`,
  rebuilds, and restarts. Other branches, local commits, and uncommitted tracked
  changes block the update with an explanation.

bb does not roll back an update. If the new version fails to start, bb exits
with its error and the next start runs the new version again, as it would after
a manual upgrade. Run a newer release (`npx bb-app@latest`) or fix the cause; an
older release may not open a database the new version migrated. A source
checkout whose rebuild fails stays on the new commit; fix the build and run
`pnpm start` again. Download, install, and fast-forward failures happen before
bb stops, so the current version keeps running.

The outcome is recorded in `<dataDir>/bb-app-update.json` once bb starts
cleanly, and shown in Settings → Updates, `bb updates app`, and the API until
dismissed. Do not edit that file. If bb is stopped during the restart, an npm
install starts the new version next time, while a source checkout stays on its
current commit and reports the update as failed. Only one launcher manages
updates for a data directory:
a second `bb-app start` on the same data directory runs with in-app updates off,
and `bb-app stop` stops the managing launcher. If threads start while an update
downloads and you did not agree to interrupt threads, bb cancels the restart and
asks you to update again.

A server the desktop app starts updates with the desktop app instead. When the
desktop app connects to a server it did not start, Settings → Updates lists
**bb server** (updated in-app on that server's machine) and **bb desktop** (this
app's own relaunch update) separately. `pnpm dev`, `bb-server`, and a standalone
`bb-host-daemon` do not offer in-app updates. Updating restarts bb,
which interrupts running threads; the app and CLI ask first.

`BB_APP_UPDATE_MODE`, `BB_APP_INSTALL_KIND`, `BB_APP_SOURCE_ORIGIN`, and
`BB_APP_SOURCE_COMMIT` are internal markers the launcher passes to its server
child; do not set them yourself.

The `bb` CLI records each failed invocation on the machine that ran it, in
`<data dir>/logs/cli-errors.jsonl`: the time, CLI version, command path, error
code, exit code, current thread ID, and the unknown command or flag. It never
records argument values or error text. The file rotates to `cli-errors.jsonl.1`
at 2 MB. `bb diagnostics cli-errors [--since 7d] [--json]` tallies it and
`--clear` deletes it. Set `BB_CLI_ERROR_LOG=0` in the environment that runs `bb`
to turn recording off.

## AI services

Thread titles (and the branch names built from them), commit messages, and
voice transcripts come from AI services that plugins register. Choose one per
task in Settings → AI services or with the CLI:

```bash
bb settings ai-services
bb settings ai-services set commit-message my-openrouter
bb settings ai-services set voice off
bb settings ai-services test thread-title
```

Each task is `automatic` (the default), `off`, or a service id. A service is
identified by its plugin and its id, so two plugins may register the same id;
pass `--plugin <plugin-id>` to `set` when they do. Automatic tries
bb cloud (`bb`, the `bb-ai` plugin, for a signed-in bb account) first,
then all other registered services in lexicographic order of plugin id and
service id, including third-party plugins. Only services supporting the task
participate; unavailable services and failed requests fall through to the next.
Codex (`codex`, the `provider-codex` plugin) uses the Codex CLI login on the
primary machine. bb cloud is on by default once you sign in; `bb ai off` turns it off
(it then sends nothing to getbb.app) and `bb ai on` turns it back on. A service you pick
is used alone; if it fails, titles fall back to the start of the prompt and
commits to `bb: automated commit`. Each plugin picks its own model.

`BB_INFERENCE`, `BB_INFERENCE_FALLBACK`, and `BB_TRANSCRIPTION` were removed.
bb ignores them in `~/.bb/config.json` with a warning, and `bb-app config set`
refuses them.

With a ChatGPT subscription login, Codex voice transcription posts to a
`chatgpt.com` endpoint that sits behind Cloudflare bot protection. On some
networks Cloudflare challenges that request and transcription fails. If that
happens often, run `codex login --with-api-key` on the primary machine, or pick
another voice service.

bb accepts voice recordings up to 25 MB. A service may set a lower limit;
Codex transcribes recordings up to 20 MB and bb cloud up to 10 MB.

Open microphone preferences by right-clicking the composer microphone or pressing
Shift+F10 while it is focused. A warning opens preferences when the microphone
is clicked. Desktop uses an anchored popover; mobile uses a drawer. Opening
preferences starts a local microphone preview with the recording waveform and
a list of inputs. Closing preferences releases the preview. The recording controls
contain only cancel, stop, and send; microphone preferences are available while idle.

Recording tries the preferred device, then the system default, then other
available inputs for missing or unreadable devices. Permission denials do not
trigger fallback. A disconnect during recording switches the input into the
same recorder, preserving audio captured before the disconnect. Reconnecting
the preferred microphone makes it available for the next recording; it does not
interrupt the current fallback recording.

A missing preferred microphone alone does not block recording or show a warning.
Capture failures, interrupted input, or no available inputs after access was
granted show a decorative warning badge on the idle microphone. During capture,
five seconds of near-silent audio produces a warning in the open preview or an
accessible status in the recording row; the recording row has no microphone menu. Silence warnings clear when audio returns and never
stop recording or switch microphones automatically. While idle, a warning opens
preferences on click. Audio preview runs only while microphone preferences are
open; it is not saved or transcribed.

The microphone picker in Settings → Voice Input is client-local. It stores the
selected browser `MediaDevices` device id in localStorage as
`bb.voiceInput.audioInputDeviceId`. Recording prefers that microphone and falls
back to the system default and other available inputs when it is disconnected,
then uses the saved preference again when it reconnects. Select System default to follow system
microphone changes; it does not change which service
transcribes.

The built-in Push notifications plugin uses `expoPushUrl` for its relay URL.
The default is `https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send`. Change it with
`bb plugin config push-notifications set expoPushUrl <url>`. The plugin reads
the value when it sends a message. Independent `mobileEnabled`, `webEnabled`,
and `desktopEnabled` booleans default to true. Change each with
`bb plugin config push-notifications set webEnabled false` (or the other
channel key). Web and desktop clients receive system notifications while a bb
tab or window remains open; browsers require HTTPS or localhost and per-device
notification permission. Settings → Push notifications offers permission and
test controls. `bb push-notifications test <web|desktop>` broadcasts a test to
connected, permitted clients; it does not confirm OS display.

The builtin Keep Awake plugin has one autosaving configuration page with an
enable switch and an all-or-selected host picker. On selected macOS hosts it
runs `/usr/bin/caffeinate -i -w <worker-pid>` while enabled, preventing system
idle sleep while bb is running. It only blocks idle sleep: closing a laptop lid
or choosing Sleep manually still sleeps the Mac. Configure it from an agent or
terminal with:

```sh
bb keep-awake status [--json]
bb keep-awake enable [--json]
bb keep-awake disable [--json]
bb keep-awake hosts all
bb keep-awake hosts <host-id>...
```

The builtin Concurrency limit plugin has an autosaving page under Plugins →
Installed plugins. Its overall limit is unlimited by default. Each host defaults to
Auto: one thread per available processor. A blank host field restores
Auto, and 0 pauses new work for that scope. Configure it from an agent or
terminal with:

```sh
bb concurrency-limit status [--json]
bb concurrency-limit global [unlimited|<limit>] [--json]
bb concurrency-limit host <host-id> [auto|<limit>] [--json]
```

The "Show diagnostic events" toggle in Settings → General → Privacy & diagnostics shows provider
environment resolution and raw provider events that bb does not yet understand.
It defaults to off in all builds. Warnings, errors, and model fallback remain
visible. An existing unhandled-provider-events preference is preserved.
Set it with `bb settings general showDiagnosticEvents <true|false>` or
`bb.sdk.system.updateGeneralSettings` using the `showDiagnosticEvents` field.
For older SDK callers, the general-settings API still accepts and returns
`showUnhandledProviderEvents` as a deprecated alias. Both names control the same
setting. When a read-modify-write payload contains conflicting values, the
value changed from the saved setting wins. Hidden diagnostics do not count
toward timeline event or byte limits.

The "Default thread followup behavior" picker in Settings → General changes the
active-thread composer shortcuts when no typeahead suggestion is active. A
queued message waits and then runs when the agent stops. A steer message goes
to the agent during the current run. The picker defaults to "Steer" for a new
install: Enter steers and Command+Enter queues. "Queue" swaps them: Enter
queues and Command+Enter steers. Ctrl+Enter is the same modifier shortcut on
Windows and Linux. An earlier install with saved settings or work
keeps "Queue" because a one-time migration stamps the old default onto it. Set
it with
`bb settings general steerActiveThreadOnEnter <true|false>`, where `true` is
"Steer".

The "Thread archive confirmation" switch in Settings → General defaults to on.
Turn it off to archive a thread and its child threads immediately without a
confirmation popup. The archive toast still offers Undo. This server-wide
preference applies to all connected app clients. Set it with
`bb settings general confirmThreadArchive false` or
`bb.sdk.system.updateGeneralSettings` using `confirmThreadArchive`.
CLI and SDK archive operations remain non-interactive.

The "Streamer mode" toggle in Settings → General hides every `customModels`
entry from `~/.bb/config.json` in all model lists: the web and mobile pickers,
`bb provider models`, and `sdk.providers.models`. Turn it on before a screen
share so a private or early-access model id does not appear. It defaults to
off. The entries stay in `config.json`, and a thread that names a hidden model
explicitly still runs with it. Default model resolution for a new thread also
keeps the full list, so a provider whose only models are custom still starts.
A composer whose stored selection is a hidden model treats it as unavailable
and falls back to the provider default; the next send records that default, so
select the custom model again after you turn streamer mode off. Set it with
`bb settings general streamerMode <true|false>`.

The "Allow faster service tiers" switch in Settings → Providers defaults to on.
Turn it off with `bb settings general allowFastServiceTier false` or
`bb.sdk.system.updateGeneralSettings`. While off, new turns use the default
service tier, including explicit requests for another tier (`fast`, Codex
`ultrafast`, or any other tier a provider lists), automations, and previously
queued messages. The app hides the service tier control. Turn the setting on to
choose a faster tier again; completed turns and project defaults saved while it
was off retain the default tier.

The "New branch prefix" field in Settings → General sets the text bb
puts in front of every branch name it creates for a managed worktree or a new
checkout branch. It defaults to `bb/`, which produces
`bb/fix-login-flow-thr_ab12cd34ef`. Change it to `sawyer/` to group your branches
under your own namespace, or clear the field to create
`fix-login-flow-thr_ab12cd34ef` with no prefix. bb rejects a prefix that cannot
start a valid git branch name, such as one with a space or a leading `-`, and
the prefix is at most 64 characters. The prefix applies to branches bb creates
after you change it; it does not rename an existing branch or worktree. Set it
with `bb settings general managedBranchPrefix <prefix>`.

Settings → Providers lists every registered agent provider in picker order.
Move a provider up or down to change the order and choose the default for new
threads. Both are persisted preferences: `providerOrder` is the list of ids
that lead the picker (ids not listed follow in plugin install order, and an id
that names no registered provider is ignored) and `defaultProviderId` is the
provider new threads use when neither the caller nor the project chose one
(`null` means the first available provider in picker order). Set them with
`bb settings general providerOrder '["claude-code","codex"]'` and
`bb settings general defaultProviderId claude-code` (or `null`).

The "Collapse finished turns" switches in Settings → Providers choose, per
provider, how a finished turn appears in the thread timeline. Collapsed, the
turn's work folds into one "Worked for" row and the final answer stays
visible. Flat, every step of the finished turn stays visible, as it was while
the turn ran. Each provider declares its default (`completedTurnDisplay` on
its registration): Claude Code defaults to flat, and every other first-party
provider defaults to collapsed. Your choice is stored in
`providerCompletedTurnDisplay`, a map of provider id to `collapse` or `flat`;
a provider without an entry uses its default. The display applies to existing
threads as well as new ones, and to the conversation outline and
`bb thread log`. Set it with
`bb settings completed-turns <provider-id> <collapse|flat|default>`, where
`default` removes your entry, and list every provider's current display with
`bb settings completed-turns`.

Each provider's own options live on its plugin: Codex memory and native
subagents under the Codex provider plugin, and Claude Code memory, native
subagents, and the Workflow tool under the Claude Code provider plugin.

Claude Code's **Disable 1M context** provider setting (`disable1MContext`)
defaults to `false`. Enable it with
`bb plugin config provider-claude-code set disable1MContext true`.
bb sets `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT=1` when enabled and `0` when off.
Changes restart the thread's Claude process before its next turn, preserving
conversation context.

Claude Code starts without its Claude in Chrome browser tools when bb runs it,
even when the interactive `claude` CLI has Chrome enabled by default. Turn the
tools on for bb threads with
`bb plugin config provider-claude-code set chromeEnabled true`. bb then starts
Claude Code with `--chrome`. The host needs the Claude in Chrome extension and a
claude.ai login; API-key sessions keep Chrome off. A change restarts the thread's
Claude process before its next turn and keeps the conversation.

In Accept Edits and Approve for me modes, bb runs Claude Code's Bash commands in
Claude Code's sandbox. Turn it off with
`bb plugin config provider-claude-code set sandboxEnabled false`. Bash commands
then go through Claude Code's normal approvals and your own Claude Code
permission and sandbox settings. A change restarts the thread's Claude process
before its next turn and keeps the conversation.

Outside an open typeahead menu, Shift+Enter inserts a newline. On
coarse-pointer touch devices, the software-keyboard Return path inserts a
newline and the submit button sends.
iPadOS WebKit additionally preserves the Enter and Command+Enter shortcuts
above for a connected Magic Keyboard.

## Themes

`bb theme` controls CSS-variable overrides for the app palette and typography.
Custom themes live at `<bb-data-dir>/theme/<name>/theme.css`; use `bb theme dir`
to find the directory and `bb theme show [id] --css` to inspect resolved CSS.

The typography tokens are mode-independent and belong in the `:root, .light`
block:

- `--font-sans` controls app UI and body text.
- `--font-mono` controls code blocks, diffs, file paths, and previews.
- `--font-serif` controls serif prose.
- `--font-terminal` controls the integrated terminal's font family.

Always end font stacks with a generic fallback such as `sans-serif` or
`monospace`. The complete theme token reference is in the bb-cli skill's
`references/theming.md`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

`Mod+Shift+P` opens the quick palette: type to filter, then run a command with
Enter. It lists only commands that apply on the current surface, shows each
one's shortcut, and offers recently run commands first. The numbered
accelerator families and the relative cycle commands stay rebindable but
unlisted. Plugins can add their own rows, listed under "Plugins".

Settings → Keyboard edits app command shortcuts. Overrides are stored in the
server database, applied live to every connected window, and kept across
restarts. Resetting a shortcut removes its override so future bb releases can
continue to update the default. Clearing a shortcut explicitly disables that
command. Command context and native-only availability remain server-owned and
are not editable. Actions supported by both clients use the same resolved
bindings in the browser and desktop app; browsers may still reserve some chords
before bb receives them.

`Mod` means Command on macOS and Control on Windows/Linux. Numbered thread and
pane shortcuts follow Slack's browser-safe convention: web uses
`Control+1…9` on macOS and `Ctrl+Shift+1…9` on Windows/Linux, while desktop
uses `Mod+1…9`. The web aliases leave native browser `Mod+1…9` tab switching
untouched. Previous and next thread use `Mod+Shift+[/]` on desktop and
`Control+Shift+[/]` on the web.

On macOS, right-panel tabs use `panel.previousTab` / `panel.nextTab` with
`Command+Control+ArrowLeft` / `Command+Control+ArrowRight`. They wrap through visible
tabs and each pane's New tab button in displayed order across the active
chat's right-panel groups. Press Enter or Space on New tab to open the picker.
On the selected New tab page, `panel.previousNewTabItem` /
`panel.nextNewTabItem` use `Command+Control+ArrowUp` / `Command+Control+ArrowDown` to
move through search, enabled actions, and recent items in displayed order.
Search results replace actions and recents while searching. Enter activates
the focused item.
The initially unassigned `panel.fullScreen.toggle` command runs the right
panel's Full Screen / Exit Full Screen control while the panel is open. In a
split right panel it maximizes the focused group.
Chat splits use `pane.focus.left` / `right` / `up` / `down` with
`Command+Control+Shift+ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight` / `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` on macOS. These move
spatially to the adjacent chat pane, including stacked splits, and stop at the
layout edge. The initially unassigned `pane.focus.previous` / `pane.focus.next`
commands still cycle in reading order. On Windows/Linux, these arrow navigation
commands start unassigned to preserve native Control-arrow editing shortcuts.
Rebind any of these commands in Settings → Keyboard, via
`bb settings keyboard set <command> <shortcut|disabled>`, or SDK
`system.updateKeyboardSettings`; read bindings with `system.config`.
Use `bb settings keyboard reset <command>` to adopt the current default.
Overrides can specify `platform: "mac"`, `"windows"`, or `"linux"`; omission applies
on all platforms. A platform-specific override takes precedence over a general one,
including when disabled. UI edits and clears apply only to the current platform;
UI resets remove overrides for the current platform so web and desktop each use
their own defaults. Shared overrides become explicit bindings on the other platforms
to preserve their behavior. Explicit overrides remain resettable even when they match
a default shortcut.
CLI `set` and `reset` accept `--platform mac|windows|linux`; scoped operations retain
other platforms. Unscoped `set` updates the general override; unscoped `reset`
clears all scopes for the selected command (or every command if omitted).

Plugin commands use `plugin:<plugin-id>/<command-id>` as their stable binding
ID. For example: `bb settings keyboard set plugin:example/open-issue Mod+Shift+I`.
`bb settings keyboard reset plugin:example/open-issue` restores the plugin's
default; `set ... disabled` explicitly unbinds it. The SDK supports the same IDs
through `system.updateKeyboardSettings` and `system.config`.
Overrides survive plugin disable/re-enable and reload. Every active plugin
command appears in Keyboard Settings; commands without defaults start unbound.
Conflicting plugin defaults stay unbound and display the conflicting command.
The UI offers Replace binding or Cancel when assigning an occupied shortcut.
`keyboard list` includes all saved overrides and core effective bindings;
plugin defaults and availability are resolved in each app window, where the
plugin frontend runs. CLI/SDK callers should clear conflicting explicit
bindings in the same update; plugin defaults yield to explicit bindings.

The "Show keyboard hints when holding CMD / Control" preference defaults
to on. Set it with
`bb settings keyboard hints <true|false>`. Turning it off hides the
delayed shortcut badges without disabling any shortcuts.

Cycle commands wrap in both directions. Reasoning cycles only through the
current model's supported efforts in canonical low-to-high rank order, not the
provider response order. The cycle shortcuts act only from the active composer
or an open picker; unrelated editable controls retain their Option-composed
character input. A configured app shortcut takes precedence in editable
controls; when no matching command handles a chord, the control retains its
native behavior.

The desktop application menu uses the same resolved bindings for New Thread,
New Window, New Tab, Close, and Settings. There is no separate menu shortcut
configuration.

`BB_SERVER_URL` does not change where full `npx bb-app` startup binds locally.
It is for commands that need to target an already-running server, such as the
bundled `bb` CLI or a standalone host daemon. The CLI can omit it when targeting
the default local packaged server at `http://127.0.0.1:38886`; set it for remote
or non-default servers.

## Client SSH Targets

`~/.bb/client.json` is local to the machine showing the UI. The CLI resolves the
remote server's host ID and stores a mapping from that server/work-host to an SSH
target known to the local machine. The remote server does not read this file.

Example:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "https://bb.example.test": {
      "hosts": {
        "host_abc": {
          "sshAuthority": "devbox"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When a remote bb page asks the local helper to open a work-host path, the helper
uses this mapping to launch remote-capable editors and terminals over SSH.
Browsers or devices without a helper can still use bb; local editor actions are
simply unavailable.

## Provider availability

Settings → Providers lists disabled providers below enabled providers in the same
list. Only enabled providers can be reordered. Each row’s three-dot menu enables
or disables the provider, or makes an enabled provider the default. Enable
restores a provider and, if needed, its supplying plugin.
Disabling an individual provider leaves its plugin, sibling providers, installed
CLI, and existing threads intact. In-flight turns can finish; new turns and
sessions are rejected until the provider is enabled again. Queued messages and
automations are subject to the same server-side check.

```bash
bb provider list --all
bb provider disable acp-opencode
bb provider enable claude-code
```

`bb provider list` and thread pickers omit disabled providers. `list --all`
shows the global management catalog, including providers whose plugins are off;
it cannot be combined with machine or environment selectors. Enabling a shared
plugin preserves individual provider opt-outs. Disabling the selected default
clears that choice, allowing the next enabled provider in saved order to be used.
A project whose last-used provider is disabled also falls back to that order;
explicitly requesting a disabled provider is still rejected.

The core `disabledProviderIds` value lists disabled providers by ID. It is stored
apart from Settings → General, so only the provider enable/disable route, CLI and
SDK change it; a general-settings save, even from a stale client, cannot. Enable
removes the ID, so the provider returns to its automatic discovery behavior:
agents such as `acp-opencode` again appear only where their CLI is installed.
Uninstalling a plugin forgets the disabled state of its providers.

The SDK exposes `sdk.providers.catalog()` and
`sdk.providers.setEnabled({ providerId: "acp-opencode", enabled: false })`.
Install provider plugins in Settings → Plugins. Configure custom ACP agents in
the ACP providers plugin settings.

## Custom ACP Agents

Known ACP agents appear when their CLI is installed on the host. bb exposes
`acp-opencode` when `opencode` is on PATH and can be launched as `opencode acp`,
`acp-omp` when `omp` (oh-my-pi) is on PATH, `acp-grok` when Grok Build's `grok`
CLI is on PATH and can be launched as `grok agent stdio`, and
`acp-hermes-agent` when Hermes' `hermes` CLI is on PATH. `acp-cursor` is always
listed.

Add your own agent through the ACP providers plugin's `customAgents` setting,
which holds a JSON array. In the app it is the multi-line editor on the
plugin's settings page (Settings → Plugins → ACP providers); from the CLI:

```bash
bb plugin config provider-acp set customAgents '[
  {"id": "amp", "displayName": "Amp", "command": "amp", "args": ["acp"]}
]'
```

Each entry needs `id` (lowercase letters, digits and dashes), `displayName`,
and `command`. bb derives the provider id `acp-<id>`; it never changes once a
thread has used it. An id bb always lists (`cursor`) is reserved; an id bb
lists only where the agent is installed (`opencode`, `omp`, `grok`,
`hermes-agent`) is not, so an entry with that id REPLACES the shipped agent.
A replacing entry keeps the shipped agent's `nativeSkillRoots` unless it sets
its own, and bb still lists the roots that agent's host config names (its
config directory, compat trees, configured paths, plugins) either way.
Optional fields: `args`, `env`, `cwd`, `modelCli` (CLI model listing and
selection), `reasoningCli` (launch-time reasoning flags), `nativeReasoning`
(ACP `session/set_config_option` reasoning), `nativeSkillRoots` (native skills
in the composer, as `{"user": [...], "project": [...]}` relative paths; an
entry is a path or `{"path": ..., "recursive": true, "ancestors": true}` for
an agent that nests skills or reads them from every ancestor directory),
`permissionCli` (permission-mode launch flags), `supportsManualCompaction`
(only if the agent accepts an explicit compaction request — bb hides
`/compact` otherwise), and `dialect` (the vendor side channels bb reads for
the agent: `cursor`, `opencode`, `omp`, or `grok`).

The change applies immediately: the plugin re-registers its providers when the
setting changes, with no restart and no `config refresh`.

A configured agent's command is local code execution and only works with a
co-located daemon.

BB launches OpenCode sessions with `OPENCODE_CLIENT=acp` and
`OPENCODE_ENABLE_QUESTION_TOOL=false`, overriding inherited and custom launch
values. Native questions have no ACP interaction handler in BB; agents use the
ask-user-question plugin’s `AskUserQuestion` tool instead. This also applies to
custom agents with `dialect: "opencode"` and does not change OpenCode config files.

## OpenCode Go Usage

OpenCode Go subscription usage uses the credentials configured on the selected
machine. Sign in to Go in OpenCode there, then select that machine in Provider
usage or run `bb settings usage --machine <id-or-name> --json`. BB reads
`OPENCODE_API_KEY` first, then the active official Console account and organization
from `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/opencode.db`, then `OPENCODE_AUTH_CONTENT` or
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/auth.json` (default data directory `~/.local/share/opencode`).
Console account storage is read only; OpenCode owns refreshing expired sessions.
The `opencode-go` API key takes precedence over the shared `opencode` key.
Custom ACP launch `env` overrides apply to credential lookup; a custom wrapper
must declare `dialect: "opencode"` and `providerUsage: true`. The endpoint requires
an active Go subscription and reports its five-hour, weekly, and monthly quota
windows, not other providers' usage or Zen pay-as-you-go spending.

## Custom Models

Register extra picker models by editing top-level `customModels` in
`~/.bb/config.json`. Use this for a model the provider accepts but does not
list, such as a non-public preview id. This list has no set/unset CLI surface:
edit the JSON, then run `npx bb-app config refresh` or restart bb. `bb-app config list` prints the entries.

```json
{
  "customModels": [
    { "providerId": "claude-code", "model": "claude-example-preview" },
    {
      "providerId": "acp-my-agent",
      "model": "my-proxy/my-model",
      "displayName": "My Proxy Model"
    }
  ]
}
```

`providerId` accepts a built-in provider id (`codex`, `claude-code`, `pi`,
`acp-cursor`) or any `acp-*` provider id: an installed-only plugin provider
such as `acp-opencode`, or a custom ACP agent's derived `acp-<id>`. `displayName` is
optional; bb derives the label from the model id when it is omitted. bb skips
an invalid entry with a warning and keeps the rest of the config.

Each entry appears in `bb provider models <providerId>` and in the model
picker after the provider's own catalog. The provider catalog wins on a model
id collision. The "Streamer mode" General setting
(`bb settings general streamerMode true`) hides every entry from these lists
until you turn it off again.

A `customModels` entry only makes the id selectable; the provider must still
accept it. Built-in providers such as `claude-code` and `codex` accept
unlisted ids. An ACP agent receives the id over the protocol at session start
and can reject it. OpenCode rejects a model that is not in its own catalog,
so do not pin OpenCode models here: add the model to the OpenCode config and
bb discovers it automatically.

An OpenCode "agent" (build, plan, or a custom primary agent) is a session
mode, not a model, so it does not belong in `customModels`. bb does not select
OpenCode agents; set the default agent in the OpenCode config instead.

## Agent Instructions

bb can inject user-level and workspace-level agent instructions into every
provider-backed thread's system prompt, alongside the skills convention.

For user-level defaults across projects, create `AGENTS.md` in the bb data dir:

```
<dataDir>/AGENTS.md
```

For repo-specific guidance, create `.bb/AGENTS.md` at the workspace root:

```
<workspace>/.bb/AGENTS.md
```

The file contents are appended alongside enabled plugin instructions when a
provider session starts, so the guidance applies regardless of which provider
runs. When both files exist, `<dataDir>/AGENTS.md` is appended first and
`<workspace>/.bb/AGENTS.md` second. An empty or whitespace-only file is treated
as absent.

No agent loads `.bb/AGENTS.md` natively. Provider-native instruction files
remain separate. Codex reads a repo-root `AGENTS.md`. Claude Code 2.1.277 and
later also reads `AGENTS.md` when no project or ancestor `CLAUDE.md` or
`CLAUDE.local.md` takes precedence. Older Claude Code versions and sessions
without its built-in `AGENTS.md` support still require `CLAUDE.md`. bb reads
the files above itself and injects them, so use them for guidance you want every
bb thread to receive regardless of provider.

## Skills

User-level bb skills live under `<dataDir>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; for the
packaged app this is usually `~/.bb/skills`. Project skills live under
`<workspace>/.bb/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and override same-named user or plugin
skills. Running plugins contribute another tier: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
files in an installed plugin (relocatable via the manifest's `bb.skills` field)
are imported while the plugin is loaded, subject to its agent configuration.
Project and user skills override plugin skills by name. BB guide owns the
four bundled core skills and can disable them together or individually.

bb indexes each provider's native skill roots for that provider's `/` command
menu. Each provider plugin declares where its agent keeps skills and slash
commands, and resolves on the host what only that machine and workspace know
(a moved config directory, installed vendor plugins, config-file entries); bb
itself knows no agent's layout. The Skills page and `bb skill list` show
native skills for every provider whose plugin declares or resolves roots. The
table lists what the shipped plugins declare and resolve.

| Provider     | User roots                                                                                               | Project roots                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Codex        | `~/.agents/skills`, `$CODEX_HOME/skills`                                                                 | `.agents/skills` from the repository root to the current directory, plus `.codex/skills`                     |
| Claude Code  | `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills` or `~/.claude/skills`, plus enabled plugin skills                            | `.claude/skills` from the repository root to the current directory, plus enabled plugin skills               |
| Pi           | `~/.pi/agent/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`                                                                 | `.pi/skills` and `.agents/skills` from the repository root to the current directory                          |
| Cursor       | `~/.cursor/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`                            | The same four roots in the workspace                                                                         |

| omp          | The active `~/.omp/.../agent` roots and supported Pi, Agents, Claude, Codex, and OpenCode roots          | `.omp/skills` and the supported compatibility roots from the repository root to the current directory        |
| Grok Build   | `$GROK_HOME/skills` or `~/.grok/skills`, plus `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.cursor/skills` | The same four roots from the repository root to the current directory                                        |
| Hermes Agent | `$HERMES_HOME/skills` or `~/.hermes/skills`                                                              | None                                                                                                         |

OpenCode also uses `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/skills` when that variable exists.
Pi and omp use `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` when that variable exists. omp also uses
`$OMP_PROFILE` or `$PI_PROFILE` to select its active profile root. Cursor and
Hermes can organize skills in category directories. bb scans those roots
recursively. Pi settings and packages can add skill paths. omp reads
`skills.customDirectories` from its YAML configuration. Hermes reads
`skills.external_dirs` from `config.yaml`.

Grok reads recursive paths from `[skills].paths` in `config.toml`. It also reads
enabled Grok and Claude-compatible plugin skills. Its Cursor and Claude
compatibility roots follow the related config and environment switches.

## Multi-machine

Settings → Machines offers Manual machine setup (the built-in `manual` provider)
alongside installed cloud, SSH and Tailscale providers. Manual machine setup prints
a private enrollment command and waits for the daemon. The one-line command
downloads `/install.sh` with a short-lived enrollment header. The server embeds
the pending bootstrap in its uncached response; cancelled, expired, or consumed
enrollments are rejected. `bb machine create
--provider manual` follows the same lifecycle; `--no-wait` returns the creating
host ID. Manual machines never suspend or retire automatically. Removal
revokes access; run the original installer with `--uninstall --host-id <id>` on
that machine to uninstall its daemon. The local host remains provider-less.

Settings → Machines can also rename and remove machines; project settings can add a path or clone source on
each machine; and thread creation can target any enrolled machine with a usable
source. The CLI equivalents are `bb machine list`, `bb project create
--machine <id-or-name> ...`, `bb project source add --machine <id-or-name>
...`, and `bb thread spawn --machine <id-or-name> ...`.

Multi-machine execution is independent of browser access. Tailscale and bb
connect let another browser reach the bb server; multi-machine support lets
that server dispatch work to host daemons on other machines. The Settings → Machines
installer can use a paired bb connect account to route the daemon and its CLI
back to the server. Machine credentials remain locally managed as described at
the top of this document.

Each machine has a permission ceiling (`maxPermissionMode`, default `full`).
The server resolves every thread on that machine down to the ceiling, so a
paired sandbox machine can keep Full Access while a personal machine stays at
Approve for me or Accept Edits. A provider that supports no mode under the
ceiling is refused on that machine. Only an owner session sets it, on the machine
page (Settings → Machines → the machine, which also carries that machine's
projects, provider CLIs, update state, and rename/remove); it is deliberately
absent from the SDK and the `bb` CLI,
and machine credentials are rejected at both the bb connect gate and the
server. The boundary it defends is machine-to-machine: a process already
running on the server machine has the data directory and the server itself, so
it is trusted as the owner here exactly as it is for renaming or removing a
machine. The current value is readable through the host API and
`bb machine list --json`.

Machine installation and daemon protocol repair use the owning server as the
distribution source: `/install/version` reports the server package/protocol and
`/install/bb-app.tgz` serves its exact host-only package with a SHA-256 digest
and strong ETag. That package contains the daemon, its workers and native
dependencies, and the bundled `bb` CLI; it omits the server and web app. The
installer verifies the digest and skips the download and npm install when its
recorded installed digest receives `304 Not Modified`. It falls back to the npm
registry only when the package route returns 404. When the server cannot prepare
the package, the route returns a generic reason and a diagnostic ID, and the
installer prints them; the full exception is logged with that ID as "Host
package download failed". It
installs the package under the machine's bb data directory rather than npm's
system-wide prefix, so enrollment needs neither `sudo` nor a global npm configuration.
Installed services enable `--auto-update`; remove that flag from the launchd
plist or systemd user unit and reload the service to opt out. Updates only move
to a newer server protocol, retry failures with a persisted exponential backoff
from 5 seconds to 5 minutes, and never downgrade a daemon. Settings → Machines
and `bb machine retry-update <id-or-name>` can bypass the current backoff after
a transient failure.

## Sidebar preferences

Sidebar layout preferences are stored on the server in a keyed registry so
every window, device, and the CLI read the same value. Each key has a typed
schema, a default, and a revision that increments on every write. Writes name
the revision they expect and receive `409 ui_preference_conflict` when another
client wrote first, so a stale window cannot silently clobber a newer value.

| Key                                  | Value                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sidebar.organizationMode`           | `project`, `chronological`, or `machine`                                                  |
| `sidebar.threadGrouping.environment` | `auto`, `true`, or `false`                                                                |
| `sidebar.chronologicalSort`          | `updated`, `created`, `alpha`, or `none`                                                  |
| `sidebar.sectionOrder`               | Section id list for **By project**                                                        |
| `sidebar.manualSectionOrder`         | Section id list for **Manually**                                                          |
| `sidebar.machineSectionOrder`        | Section id list for **By machine**                                                        |
| `sidebar.hiddenGroups`               | Legacy project, custom section, and machine ids migrated once into the Thread list plugin |
| `sidebar.collapsedSections`          | Collapsed built-in sections (`pinned`, `threads`)                                         |
| `sidebar.collapsedProjects`          | Collapsed project ids                                                                     |
| `sidebar.collapsedThreads`           | Thread ids whose children are collapsed                                                   |
| `sidebar.collapsedEnvironments`      | Collapsed environment ids                                                                 |
| `sidebar.collapsedThreadSections`    | Collapsed thread section ids                                                              |
| `sidebar.collapsedMachines`          | Collapsed machine ids                                                                     |
| `sidebar.footerOrder`                | Footer action order                                                                       |
| `sidebar.hiddenFooterItems`          | Footer actions moved into More                                                            |
| `sidebar.pluginPanelOrder`           | Navigation entry order                                                                    |
| `sidebar.visiblePluginPanels`        | Navigation entries shown, or `null` for every entry                                       |
| `sidebar.navigationProvider`         | Plugin key or `__automatic__` (default)                                                   |
| `sidebar.headerProvider`             | Plugin key, or `__builtin__` for bb's header only                                         |
| `sidebar.threadListProvider`         | Plugin key or `__automatic__` (default)                                                   |

The sidebar thread list defaults to `__automatic__`: the first installed thread list
plugin other than the bundled Thread list plugin (`thread-list/thread-list`), or the
bundled plugin when there is none. Installing a thread list plugin therefore switches
to it. Legacy `__builtin__` selections resolve to the bundled plugin; other plugin
selections are preserved.
Use `bb settings ui reset sidebar.threadListProvider` to restore Automatic, or
`bb settings ui set sidebar.threadListProvider <plugin-id>/<slot-id>` to select
another plugin. The SDK exposes the same setting through `uiPreferences`.

The sidebar navigation works the same way: `sidebar.navigationProvider` defaults to
`__automatic__`, which prefers an installed navigation plugin over the bundled
Navigation plugin (`navigation/navigation`), and legacy `__builtin__` selections
resolve to the bundled plugin. Order and visibility stay in
`sidebar.pluginPanelOrder` and `sidebar.visiblePluginPanels`, shared by every
navigation plugin.

`sidebar.headerProvider` picks a plugin that draws controls in the sidebar header
row, between the sidebar toggle and the back and forward buttons. It defaults to
`__builtin__`, which leaves only bb's controls there. Set it with
`bb settings ui set sidebar.headerProvider <plugin-id>/<slot-id>`.

New installations default to Custom (`chronological`) for `sidebar.organizationMode`.
Migrated installations with existing projects, threads, or UI preferences fall back
to By project (`project`). Explicit server choices take precedence over legacy
browser choices, which take precedence over this installation fallback. Reset
saves the installation fallback as an explicit choice.

The built-in sidebar defaults to Active, including threads with saved messages.
Filter selects Active and Archived and remembers the selection in this browser,
not in the server-backed preferences or SDK/CLI. There is no separate
Drafts section or filter; saved messages remain in their owning thread. The
selected archived threads retain their section, project, machine, and pin placement.
Choose Filter in a sidebar header's combined actions menu to change the selection.
The combined menu offers Organize, Sort by, and Filter.
Organize retains its Sections choices and Groups → By environment toggle.
Desktop archived rows have a persistent Unarchive icon
that restores the thread without navigating away.
Archived loads pages only while selected.
Plugin sidebar replacements own their rendering.

The palette's Filter independently selects Active and Archived before
and after typing. It defaults to Active and remembers its selection in this
browser only; it is not configurable through SDK/CLI.
Active includes threads with saved messages. Search threads retains the existing
title and conversation search behavior and opens the owning thread.
Archived loads a bounded list in most-recently-archived order only while selected.
Search uses the existing
ranked Active/Archived response and displays the selected groups, with six initial
rows in one group or three each when both are nonempty, plus Show more.

`sidebar.threadGrouping.environment` decides whether two or more sibling threads
that share one worktree environment collapse into a single worktree row inside
their section. `true` groups them and `false` keeps every thread on its own row,
in every organization mode. The default, `auto`, groups them in **By project**
and **By machine** and leaves them flat in **Custom**, which is how each mode
behaved before the preference existed. Set this preference through Organize →
Groups → By environment, settings, or
`bb settings ui set sidebar.threadGrouping.environment true`; an explicit
`true` or `false` applies to every mode.

Each `sidebar.threadGrouping.*` key toggles one grouping dimension
independently, so a future dimension adds a key rather than changing this one.

Read and write them with:

```sh
bb settings ui list [--json]
bb settings ui get <key> [--json]
bb settings ui set <key> <value> [--json]
bb settings ui reset <key> [--json]
```

`set` takes a plain string for enum and provider keys and JSON for lists and
`null`, for example `bb settings ui set sidebar.organizationMode machine` or
`bb settings ui set sidebar.sectionOrder '["threads","pinned","projects"]'`.
It reads the current revision first and retries once on a conflict. `reset`
writes the default and advances the revision. The SDK exposes the same
operations as `sdk.system.uiPreferences.list()`, `.set({ key, value,
expectedRevision })`, and `.reset({ key })` over `GET /preferences/ui`,
`PUT /preferences/ui/:key`, and `DELETE /preferences/ui/:key`. Every write
broadcasts a `ui-preferences-changed` system change to connected clients.

The sidebar waits for these values alongside the project list, so it never
paints a default layout that then snaps to the saved one. The first client to
reach a server that has never stored a key uploads the value it finds in the
old browser storage once, then deletes that copy, so an existing layout
survives the upgrade; a second device that loses that race adopts the server
value. A change on one device reaches every other connected window through the
`ui-preferences-changed` broadcast without a reload.

Sidebar width and open state stay in the browser because they depend on the
window size, and each browser tab or desktop window keeps its own. Collapsing or
resizing the sidebar in one tab leaves every other open tab alone; a newly
opened tab or window starts from the most recent choice made anywhere in this
browser.

### Thread-list visibility

Choose **Hide from list** in Threads, a project, custom section, or machine's menu to
move it into **More**. Its menu in More offers **Add to list** to restore it.
**Customize list** manages visibility and order for the current
organization. Hiding a group preserves its threads, saved order, and collapse
state; pinned threads stay in Pinned. Hidden work remains reachable through More,
search, and direct links. More shows activity without automatically restoring
hidden groups.

The Thread list plugin's `hiddenGroups` preference defaults to `[]` and accepts `threads`,
`project:<projectId>`, `section:<sectionId>`, and `machine:<hostId>` keys
(`machine:no-machine` for the unassigned machine group). Each organization uses
only its matching keys; `threads` applies to every organization. Pinned cannot
be hidden. Duplicate keys are deduplicated; unavailable IDs are retained
without creating sidebar rows, and new groups default to visible.

```sh
bb thread-list prefs get hiddenGroups
bb thread-list prefs set hiddenGroups '["threads","project:proj_example","section:sec_example"]'
bb thread-list prefs reset hiddenGroups
```

`set` replaces the complete list across organizations, so include any existing
keys you want to keep hidden. `reset` restores the default empty list and shows
every group. The plugin's `setPreference` and `resetPreference` RPCs expose the
same operations to its app client.

### Thread row actions

**Customize row actions**, in a thread row's actions menu, picks
the quick-action buttons a thread row shows on hover, left of its actions menu.
It previews a thread row with three action slots; click a slot to pick an
action for it or Hide to empty it. Picking an action that is already in another slot swaps
the two. Drag a filled slot onto another to reorder them. Hiding every slot
leaves only the actions menu.
Archived rows keep their unarchive button regardless of this setting.

The Thread list plugin's `rowActions` preference defaults to `["archive"]` and
accepts up to three of `split`, `copyLink`, `read`, `pin`, `move`, `rename`, and
`archive`, in display order. Duplicates are deduplicated. `split` is skipped
where a split is unavailable, and `move` is skipped for threads that cannot
move to another section. `move` opens a menu of sections.

```sh
bb thread-list prefs get rowActions
bb thread-list prefs set rowActions '["pin","copyLink","archive"]'
bb thread-list prefs set rowActions '[]'
bb thread-list prefs reset rowActions
```

### Sidebar footer

The footer shows as many icons as fit the sidebar's width, followed by an
always-available More menu. More lists hidden actions and actions that don't
fit, plus Customize footer and Hide footer. Hide footer moves every action into
More, leaving only the More button; the same menu item then reads Show footer,
which shows them again. Customize footer replaces the
footer row with an editor split into Footer and More menu zones: remove an icon
with its minus badge (its slot stays empty and current overflow stays hidden in
More), add a More item with its plus button (disabled while the footer has no
room), and drag within either zone to reorder. Customize footer and
Customize sidebar close each other. Right-click an action and choose Hide from
footer, or Customize footer. Settings → Appearance → Sidebar footer edits the
same preferences. Apart from the minus badge, width overflow never changes saved
visibility, and every action in More remains usable.
Hiding an open disclosure closes it; selecting it from More opens it again.

The UI preferences `sidebar.footerOrder` and `sidebar.hiddenFooterItems` contain
stable IDs: `builtin:settings`, `builtin:report-bug`, and
`plugin:<encoded pluginId>/<encoded registrationId>` (URI-encoded components).
Unknown and disabled-plugin IDs are retained across reloads; new actions default
visible. The existing SDK UI preferences and CLI manage the same values:

```sh
bb settings ui set sidebar.hiddenFooterItems '["builtin:report-bug"]'
bb settings ui set sidebar.footerOrder '["builtin:report-bug","builtin:settings"]'
bb settings ui reset sidebar.hiddenFooterItems
```

## Thread splits

Thread splits enable up to eight panes in the app's multi-pane thread view and
its sidebar, menu, and keyboard split controls. Edge placement creates panes
through the eighth pane; at the eight-pane limit, opening a new thread with an
edge placement replaces the focused pane. Every pane header can temporarily
maximize that pane without unmounting or resizing the underlying split tree;
the same control restores the exact arrangement. Maximization follows focus and
newly opened panes, closing the maximized pane restores the surviving layout,
and both the split tree and maximized pane restore after reload. Compact
viewports show the ordinary single-page surface while preserving that desktop
layout state.
It also enables explicit split placement through
`bb thread open <thread-id> --split right|down|left|top|replace` and the matching
SDK request, plus pane presentation controls through
`bb thread pane maximize|restore|toggle|spotlight|clear-spotlight [thread-id]` and
`sdk.threads.paneAction({ threadId, action })`. Pane actions apply only when the
target thread is already open in a multi-pane app window; the response reports
how many connected clients received the broadcast. `spotlight` focuses the
target pane and persistently dims the others; `clear-spotlight` focuses it and
persistently restores undimmed splits.

## Account Pooler [Experimental]

The builtin Account Pooler plugin is disabled on fresh installations. It stores
non-secret Claude and Codex account metadata in plugin KV, quota observations
in the plugin SQLite database, and each account token plus per-machine hub
tokens in 0600 files under
`<data-dir>/plugins/account-pool/secrets/accounts/`.
Enable it and add at least one account:

```sh
bb plugin enable account-pool
bb pool account add --provider claude --login
printf '%s\n' "$CLAUDE_AUTH_CODE" | bb pool account login-complete --session <id> --code-stdin
bb pool account add --provider codex --login
bb pool account login-poll --session <id>
bb pool account add --provider claude --import
bb pool account add --provider codex --import
printf '%s\n' "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" | bb pool account add --provider claude --api-key-stdin [--label <text>] [--priority <n>]
bb pool account refresh <id>
```

The Claude login start command creates a ten-minute in-memory PKCE session,
prints a browser authorization URL and session ID, then exits. After sign-in,
pipe the code shown on Anthropic's manual callback page to
`account login-complete` with that session ID. The browser can be on a different
machine from the bb server, and the code stays out of process arguments. The
Codex login command prints a ChatGPT device verification URL, one-time code,
session ID, and an `account login-poll` command that waits until authorization
completes or expires. The Account Pooler plugin settings page exposes both flows
with **Sign in to Claude** and **Sign in to Codex**, plus Claude import,
API-key, enable/disable, and removal controls.

The CLI import paths read the Claude Code or Codex login on the bb server host.
`--api-key-stdin` reads exactly one non-empty key from piped standard input and
is the default API-key path for agents. The compatibility form `--api-key
<key>` remains available, but exposes the secret in process arguments, shell
history, and agent transcripts. The hub starts immediately, so a newly added
or enabled account is available without a plugin reload.

When the plugin has an enabled account whose secret file is readable and
valid, it automatically contributes the provider's hub route and a
machine-specific secret token to Claude Code or Codex sessions on every host.
Claude Code also receives `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` and
`_CLAUDE_CODE_ASSUME_FIRST_PARTY_BASE_URL=1`.
Codex receives `CODEX_OPENAI_BASE_URL` and the secret
`CODEX_POOL_AUTH_TOKEN`; bb applies both when launching `codex app-server`
without writing to `~/.codex/config.toml`.
Codex image generation and editing use the same authenticated pool route.
Claude Code disables tool search behind a custom base URL by default; the hub
forwards `tool_reference` blocks unchanged, so the override keeps it on.
Behind a custom base URL, Claude Code also limits Opus models without a `[1m]`
suffix to a 200k context window. The hub forwards to Anthropic's API, so the
second override gives pooled sessions the same native context window as a
direct login.
Tokens are never printed
by the CLI. Plugin startup and `bb pool status` remove token files for machines
that are no longer enrolled. Status lists token mint and last-use timestamps
plus recently routed threads whose machines do not have a usable local Claude
login. Rotate one machine's token with
`bb pool token rotate --machine <id-or-name>`; the prior token remains valid
for ten minutes so in-flight requests can drain. Bypass or restore routing for
one thread with `bb pool bypass <thread-id>` or
`bb pool bypass <thread-id> --off`. Account listing, enable, disable, removal,
priority changes, and usage refreshes are available through
`bb pool account list|enable|disable|remove|priority|refresh`.
Provider routing is independently persisted and defaults on. Use
`bb pool routing <claude|codex> --off` to stop contributing pool environment
and health for one provider, and omit `--off` to enable it again.
OAuth accounts refresh quota from Anthropic's usage endpoint when added or
enabled and every five minutes while idle. Use `bb pool account refresh <id>`
to request an immediate refresh for one account. `account list` adds columns
for the family buckets Anthropic reports; JSON status exposes their
utilization, reset, status, observation time, and `header` or `usage` source
under `familyWeekly`. Requests route around an account spent for their model family
without disabling that account for other families. Imported and newly signed-in
accounts retain their Anthropic account UUID, and the hub aligns a present
`metadata.user_id` account component with the selected account.

Accounts run sequentially per provider: lower priority numbers first, with ties
following the order accounts were added. New conversations use the current
account until it reaches the switch threshold or fails; the pool then advances
to the next eligible account and wraps at the end. It keeps using that fallback
even when an earlier account recovers. Existing conversations stay pinned while
their account remains eligible. Short temporary rate limits wait on the same
account once; longer holds return Retry-After for pinned conversations while new
conversations can advance. A model-family limit detours only requests for that
family without moving the session's main pin or the provider cursor. The cursor
and session pins survive hub restarts. Session pins expire after 30 idle minutes,
and the pool retains the 4,096 most recently used pins.

Use the up/down arrows in Account Pooler settings, or
`bb pool account reorder <claude|codex> <id>...`, to set the complete order for
one provider. Include disabled accounts too. Reordering changes the next failover
sequence without moving the current account. `bb pool account priority <id> <n>`
sets an individual priority; the same operations are available through the
`account.reorder` and `account.setPriority` plugin RPCs.

Three plugin-owned configuration values control routing. `switchThreshold` is
the shared or requested model-family quota fraction at which an account stops
receiving matching traffic and defaults to `0.98`.
`anthropicUpstreamBaseUrl` defaults to `https://api.anthropic.com` and
`codexUpstreamBaseUrl` defaults to
`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`. Codex uses the hub's HTTP Responses
and models routes; the hub forwards each request upstream over HTTPS SSE
without keeping session state. Both URL values exist only for tests and QA
with a controlled fake upstream. Inspect or update the full plugin KV-backed configuration with:

```sh
bb pool config
bb pool config set switchThreshold 0.98
bb pool config set anthropicUpstreamBaseUrl http://127.0.0.1:9000
bb pool config set codexUpstreamBaseUrl http://127.0.0.1:9001
```

Upgrading from an Account Pooler build that stored these values through
`bb.settings` resets the threshold and both QA-only upstream overrides to
their defaults. Those old values are not migrated.

## bb connect

Remote access makes this bb server reachable at `https://<handle>.getbb.app`
once it is signed in to a getbb.app account. Two builtin plugins share the
work:

- **bb account** (`plugins/bb-account/`) signs this bb in and holds the
  server credential in its plugin KV (in `bb.db`). It never returns the
  credential; other plugins make hosted requests through its
  `bb-account.v1.fetch` rpc, and only the connect plugin may use its
  `/api/connect/` paths. Sign in with `bb account login` (a getbb.app link and
  code to approve in any browser) or Settings → bb account. `bb account status`
  shows the account, including a paired bb whose account hasn't loaded yet
  (it keeps retrying). `bb account logout` revokes the credential on
  getbb.app and forgets it; if getbb.app can't be reached, it still signs out
  locally and says the server wasn't revoked.
- **connect** (`plugins/connect/`) uses bb account's credential. Its
  background service holds the tunnel: it dials the gate with the server
  credential it reads from bb account, proxies relayed requests to the
  server's own loopback (which serves the SPA, `/api`, and `/ws`), and
  reconnects with capped backoff. When the gate refuses the credential, bb
  account checks it with getbb.app and signs out if it was revoked. It also
  keeps a copy of the pairing where bb
  builds from before bb account look for it, so downgrading keeps remote
  access. The tunnel lives as long
  as the bb server runs and re-establishes on restart; there is no foreground
  client.

The getbb.app dashboard's pairing command,
`bb connect --code <code> --server https://<handle>.getbb.app`, signs this bb
in like `bb account login --code <code>` and also turns remote access back on
if it was off. Pair from a machine without an installed bb via
`npx -p bb-app@latest bb connect …`. `--server` and `--base-url` (on both
`bb connect` and `bb account login`) accept only `https://getbb.app` and
`https://vibecodethis.site` origins (a `--server` URL is reduced to its apex);
a development build also accepts `http://bb.localhost:<port>`.

The connect plugin's `remoteAccess` setting turns remote access off and on
without signing out. `bb connect off` closes the tunnel and machine shares and
keeps the account signed in; `bb connect on` reopens them. The same setting is
the Remote access switch in Settings and
`bb plugin config connect set remoteAccess <true|false>`. `bb account logout`
forgets the pairing, and disabling the plugin (`bb plugin disable connect`)
cuts off all remote access until `bb plugin enable connect`.

`bb connect status` shows the connect state and every share's host and URL.
`bb connect expose <port>` run from a thread shares that thread environment's
enrolled host. Server-host URLs remain
`https://<server-label>--<port>.getbb.app`; other machines use
`https://<machine-label>--<port>.getbb.app` and proxy directly through the
owning daemon. Outside a thread the command defaults to the server host;
`--host <name-or-id>` overrides host resolution. Access requires the owner's
getbb.app session (not a public link). `bb connect unexpose <port>` and
`bb connect shares` use the same host resolution and accept the same `--host`
override. Their JSON rows include `hostId`, `hostName`, `port`, and `url`;
`shares --json` also includes the resolved `host`. A machine without a live
Connect enrollment fails fast with instructions to remove and re-add it in
Settings → Machines.

The CLI commands are proxied to the plugins, and Settings → bb connect
drives connect's rpc (including shared ports).

### Pairing the bb mobile app

Android source builds optionally read `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`, an absolute path
to the Firebase Android configuration file. Without it, they use
`apps/mobile/google-services.json` when present; without either, the app builds
without Firebase push configuration. For EAS, configure it as a file environment
variable. Android build, signing, and Play submission instructions are in
[`apps/mobile/README.md`](../apps/mobile/README.md#android-production-setup).

The bb mobile app reaches a paired bb through the same connect route. It
enrolls as a connect **machine** — its own credential on the getbb.app account,
separate from the server's pairing secret and individually revocable — so
pairing starts from the bb, not from the phone. No experiment is required.

- Settings → Mobile → **Add mobile device** mints a one-time code and
  shows it as a QR code plus copyable text with a countdown.
- `bb connect machine-code` prints the same code, server URL, connect apex,
  and expiry; `bb connect machine-code --json` returns
  `{code, serverUrl, apex, expiresAt}` (the QR encodes that JSON).

Scan or type the code in the mobile app. The code lasts 10 minutes and works
once. The phone then appears in the getbb.app dashboard machine list, where you
can revoke it; every enrollment takes one of the account's machine slots
(desktop apps, remote execution machines, and phones all count), so a
machine-limit error asks you to revoke an unused device first. Both surfaces
need the experiment on, the bb signed in (`bb account login`), and the connect
plugin enabled; with the experiment off the panel hides the section and
`bb connect machine-code` exits 1 with a pointer to the toggle.

## Message editing

Message editing is available for eligible, accepted root user messages in a
Codex, Claude Code, or Pi thread, including failed or incomplete turns. Grouped
multi-message requests are not yet editable. Opening the editor does not change
history; if the thread is running, submission stops the current turn and waits
for it to settle before atomically replacing that message and every later turn
while keeping workspace changes.

## Experiments

Experimental surfaces are changed in Settings → Experiments or with
`bb settings experiment <key> <true|false>`. All experiments start off.
bb stores only the experiments you set; the others follow the shipped default.
The default-off `changelogPreview` experiment shows the latest release notes
as a compact, dismissible card on Settings → Updates.

BB releases restorable provider sessions after 30 idle minutes. The daemon
checks for these sessions every five minutes. Active turns, commands, agents,
workflows, and monitors keep their sessions loaded.

Long timelines and large expanded timeline details retain stable
height-preserving wrappers while mounting only rows near their active
scrollport.

The `serverMove` experiment is off by default. When enabled, Settings → Machines
offers Move server here, and the server accepts `bb server move`,
`bb server export`, and old server copy deletion (`POST /api/v1/server/move`,
`/server/move/check`, `/server/export`, `DELETE /api/v1/hosts/:id/old-server-copy`).
While it is off those routes return 403 `server_move_experiment_disabled`;
move status and cancel stay available. Toggle it with
`bb settings experiment serverMove <true|false>`.

## Thread Timeline Window

Timeline pages select conversation groups using user-message anchors. The
`BB_FF_TIMELINE_WINDOW_EVENT_BUDGET` setting (default 1500) guides the number
of groups selected and limits the number of content leaves returned. Grouping
loads complete selected turns, their delegation descendants, and lifecycle
context. The setting is not a hard limit on query bytes, event count, or CPU:
one large turn can require substantially more work.

Pages target 4 MiB of rendered rows. An oversized group is continued by an
opaque content cursor after grouping. Turn/delegation ancestors keep their
canonical IDs, source ranges, and summary counts while their children are
paged. A single indivisible row may exceed the byte target; its content is not
silently discarded. Retained tool-output previews and full-output availability
continue to use the large-output sidecar policy.

A walk is bound to its initial history sequence, grouping version, and display
options. Appends do not move that snapshot. Edits, deletions, or out-of-order
insertions invalidate its cursor, including after a server restart. A new
latest response replaces the client's loaded snapshot when its identity
changes; old page responses cannot merge into it. This conservative behavior
also handles late events that change earlier grouping. It can require loading
older pages again during live updates.

Older activity loads as the user scrolls. `bb thread log --all` walks one
snapshot and joins repeated summary ancestors; rerun it if an edit invalidates
the walk. The API and SDK contract is described in
[timeline-pagination.md](timeline-pagination.md). The budget is a server-start
operator setting, not an app preference.

Timeline builds slower than 150ms log `Thread timeline build blocked the event
loop` with a per-stage breakdown, and event-loop stalls over 500ms log `Event
loop stalled`. Both log at `info`, so they are visible in `~/.bb/logs/` without
raising `BB_LOG_LEVEL`.

## Plugins

Plugins are on by default. Builtin plugins, including connect, ship with bb;
user-installed plugins come from `bb plugin install` or the bundled official
store.

Plugin state lives under the data dir:

```
<dataDir>/plugins/<id>/data.db     Per-plugin SQLite database
<dataDir>/plugins/<id>/secrets/    Secret settings and the plugin HTTP token
<dataDir>/plugins/<id>/logs/       bb.log output (plugin.log, JSONL, rotated
                                   at 5MB; read with `bb plugin logs <id>`)
<dataDir>/plugins/git/, npm/       Managed installs for git:/npm: sources
<dataDir>/marketplaces/staging/    Throwaway checkouts a git: marketplace
                                   refresh reads its manifest from, deleted
                                   as soon as the catalog is stored
<dataDir>/skills-generated/        Server-generated skills (the
                                   plugin-commands skill listing plugin CLI
                                   commands, injected into agent threads)
```

BB's official plugins (GitHub, Docs, Memory, and Tasks) ship bundled
inside the app and install from the local bundled copy — no network, no remote catalog.
Discover them with `bb plugin search` or Plugins → Browse plugins; users
cannot add, remove, or configure the bundled official plugin set. Installed official
plugins are pinned to the bundled copy and update with BB app releases. Local
path installs remain available directly through `bb plugin install ./path` or
`path:...`, and direct `npm:`/`git:` installs stay supported.

Marketplace catalogs and their validated icon bytes live in the bb database,
not on disk. `bb marketplace add|list|refresh|remove` and Settings → Plugin
marketplaces manage them; the reserved `bb-community` marketplace comes from
`BB_MARKETPLACE_URL` and cannot be added or removed. Adding a marketplace
installs nothing, and removing one keeps its installed plugins as direct
installs.

### Multi-plugin repositories

A repository can hold several plugins. Each plugin directory keeps its own
`package.json` and `bb` manifest; an optional `.bb/plugins.json` collection
manifest at the repository root indexes them:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://getbb.app/schemas/plugins.schema.json",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "name": "acme-plugins",
  "plugins": [
    { "name": "notes", "source": "./plugins/notes" },
    { "name": "status", "source": "./plugins/status" }
  ]
}
```

The file is strict: `schemaVersion` must be `1`, names match
`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`, unknown fields and duplicate names are rejected, and
each `source` is a repository-relative directory starting with `./` — absolute
paths, `..`, empty segments, and the repository root itself are refused. An
invalid file is rejected whole. The manifest is an index only; it never
overrides a plugin's identity, branding, entry points, or engine ranges.

Install one plugin of the repository with
`bb plugin install git:<url>[@<ref|semver-range>] --plugin <name>` (resolves a collection
entry) or `--subdirectory <relative-path>` (the primitive, which needs no
collection manifest). Both flags work for `path:` sources and are mutually
exclusive. Installs from the same repository and commit share one cached
checkout, and the selected subdirectory is recorded with the install, so
`bb plugin outdated`, `update`, rollback, and `remove` act per plugin. A
repository that has a collection manifest and is not a plugin itself refuses
an unselected install and lists its entry names.

### Plugin updates

Bundled builtin and official plugins update with BB app releases. For direct
`git:`/`npm:` installs, update application is manual: `bb plugin outdated` or
the "Check for updates" key on the Plugins page checks tracking sources, and
`bb plugin update <id>` / `bb plugin update --all` or the "Update x.y.z" pill
applies compatible candidates. The server also checks every installed plugin
every 6 hours (the first check runs when any plugin has no recorded check or
the oldest one is older than 6 hours), at most four plugins at a time, and a
manual check joins a sweep already in flight; a check only records what is
available and never installs or runs plugin code. There is no automatic plugin update
application or update audit feed. Reinstalling an already-installed managed plugin is
refused — use `bb plugin update`. Before activation bb snapshots the plugin
database, host-managed settings/storage/schedules, secrets, and registration.
A failed activation restores that snapshot and records the latest failure on
the plugin so it can be surfaced as needing attention.

### Claude Code provider

bb forwards only two environment variables to the Claude Code CLI, stripping
every other. `BB_CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` picks the `claude` binary;
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` authenticates it on a machine with no interactive
login, such as a CI runner. Mint the token with `claude setup-token`, which is
long-lived where the credentials from `/login` are not. A logged-in machine
needs neither.

### Provider retry plugin

The builtin Provider retry plugin is enabled on fresh installations. When a turn
fails on a structured Codex or Claude Code subscription-window limit that
reports a reset time, it queues that turn after the window opens. It also
retries structured provider overloads with exponential backoff and jitter.
Prior output or tool activity does not block recovery. If the provider accepted
the failed input, core sends an agent-only continuation; if it rejected the
input before starting, core re-sends the original message as agent-only. Disable
the plugin under Settings → Installed plugins or with
`bb plugin disable provider-retry`.

It never blocks a send. A remembered rate limit is a stale picture of the
provider's state, so the plugin never refuses a dispatch on one — if you raised
your plan or the window opened early, the next send simply works. The cost is
that several threads on one exhausted subscription each fail once before each
schedules its own retry; the retries are jittered so they do not all wake in the
same instant. Overload retries start after 5–10 seconds, double their delay
after each failure, and share the five-total-attempt cap with limit retries.
The `maximumWait` setting defaults to `6 hours`; resets beyond that horizon are
not scheduled. Choose `24 hours` or `No limit` under the plugin settings, or
configure it from the CLI:

```bash
bb plugin config provider-retry set maximumWait "24 hours"
```

A pending retry is a queued row on the thread, not an in-process timer, so it
survives a restart and shows its reason and time on the queue card above the
composer — the one surface that narrates the wait. Inspect them with
`bb provider-retry status`, cancel one on that card or with
`bb provider-retry cancel <thread-id>`, or run
`bb provider-retry retry <thread-id>` to send it now instead of waiting. Limits
that do not reset on a clock — credit and spend-control exhaustion — schedule
nothing, because waiting does not fix them.

### Workflows plugin

The builtin Workflows plugin is disabled on fresh installations. Enable it
under Settings → Installed plugins or with `bb plugin enable workflows`. Its six
settings are bounded integers, edited with numeric inputs under Plugins →
Installed plugins or with `bb plugin config workflows set <key> <value>`:

| Key                    |    Default |       Allowed range | Behavior                                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------: | ------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `maxActiveRuns`        |        `4` |            `1`–`32` | Concurrent runs across the plugin; changes apply live. |
| `maxConcurrentAgents`  |        `8` |            `1`–`64` | Concurrent agent calls within one run.                 |
| `maxAgentCalls`        |      `100` |          `1`–`1000` | Total agent calls within one run.                      |
| `totalRunTimeoutMs`    | `86400000` | `60000`–`604800000` | Maximum total run duration in milliseconds.            |
| `retentionDays`        |        `7` |          `1`–`3650` | Days to retain completed workflow data.                |
| `maxNotificationBytes` |    `16384` |     `1024`–`262144` | Maximum UTF-8 size of a completion notification.       |

The five settings other than `maxActiveRuns` are snapshotted into each new run.
Settings changes do not require a plugin reload.

`bb plugin install npm:<package>[@<version|tag|range>]` uses BB's shipped npm
and its running Node runtime; neither executable needs to be on PATH. Packages
are installed with `--ignore-scripts`. Git plugins also use this npm with
lifecycle scripts disabled and `--omit=dev --omit=optional`. Plugins may keep
normal development dependencies in their manifests; npm resolves these but
does not install them. They may depend on third-party runtime packages; bb
then builds both their server and frontend bundles. `node_modules` is
retained, because a dependency can load data files that bundling cannot
inline. A committed `dist/` is always replaced by the bundles bb builds.
Dependency resolution and bundling run on install and update-apply only —
never on an update check, which reads the manifest and stops. An omitted npm
spec tracks the newest compatible stable release, ranges track within the
range, dist-tags track the tag, and exact versions are pinned. A bare HTTP(S)
Git repository URL or `git:<url>[@<ref|semver-range>]` requires `git`; an
omitted ref tracks the repository's default branch, explicit branches track
their head, and tags and commits are pinned. A semver range
(`git:<url>@^1.2.0`, or `@semver:<range>` to state the intent explicitly)
tracks the repository's `[<tag-prefix>]vX.Y.Z` release tags: bb installs the
highest release the range allows, excludes prereleases unless the range names
one, records the tag and the commit it pointed at, and refuses that tag later
if it moved. `--tag-prefix <prefix>` ranges over one plugin's tags in a
multi-plugin repository. A bare range that is also a literal branch or tag
name fails the install and asks for `@semver:` or `@ref:`. Local
path installs register the directory in place and never delete it. Builtin
plugins use `builtin:<name>` and ship with bb unless removed. Managed
(`git:`/`npm:`) installs
refuse plugins whose optional `engines.bb` or `engines.bbPluginSdk` ranges
do not match the running bb/SDK, or whose `dist/*.meta.json` plugin identity
does not match the package manifest; installing a non-builtin source whose
derived id collides with a builtin name (automations, connect,
custom-instructions, inline-vis, secrets, workflows) is also refused.

`engines.bbPluginSdk` is a floor, not a ceiling. bb reads the lowest version
the range allows and runs the plugin on any SDK at or above it within the same
major, so a caret range such as `^0.4.1` keeps working after the SDK moves to
`0.4.3` or a later `0.x`. Only a plugin that asks for a newer SDK than this bb
provides, or one pinned to a different major, is incompatible. Declare the
oldest SDK you need (`>=0.4.3`); a breaking plugin API change bumps the major.

The same tracking intent drives updates: `bb plugin outdated` checks for
compatible candidates (and reports blocked incompatible newer releases);
`bb plugin update <id>` / `bb plugin update --all` applies them. Pinned source
intent is never widened by update; remove and reinstall to choose a different
source intent. Dev builds (bb `0.0.0`) do not enforce `engines.bb` and annotate
that on check results.
Update confirmation matches install (full-trust code; `--yes` skips; non-TTY
refuses without it). Plugins are full-trust code running inside the bb server
process: they can read all local bb data, including other plugins' secrets.

## Startup Flags

Use launcher flags for per-run startup details:

```bash
npx bb-app --data-dir ~/.bb-test --server-port 48886 --host-daemon-port 48887
```

The server listens on `127.0.0.1` by default. Set
`--server-bind-host 0.0.0.0` (or `BB_SERVER_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`) only when a
trusted network boundary must reach the listener directly. The public API is
unauthenticated and permits command execution and file reads, so never expose a
wildcard-bound server to an untrusted network. The only accepted bind hosts are
`127.0.0.1` and `0.0.0.0`; this startup-only setting is not available through
`bb-app config`.

The startup `Server listening` and `app` lines show the actual listener address.
With wildcard binding they show `http://0.0.0.0:<port>`, while bb's health check
and colocated host daemon continue to connect through `127.0.0.1`. That local
connection does not narrow the listener. `0.0.0.0` exposes IPv4 interfaces only;
bb does not currently offer an IPv6 wildcard bind option.

The data directory is the root directory for all bb-managed state: the SQLite
database, logs, host identity, thread storage, custom themes (`theme/`,
including optional Pierre / VS Code `pierre-dark.json` and `pierre-light.json`),
and
plugins. It defaults to `~/.bb/` for the packaged app. The `pnpm dev` source launcher derives an isolated data
directory under `~/.bb-dev/<checkout-instance>/` from the checkout path. The
checkout instance id is the sanitized path to the checkout, relative to your
home directory, plus a short hash suffix. Use `--data-dir` to point packaged-app
instances at different data directories for fully isolated environments.

If the default ports are already in use, set explicit ports before starting:

```bash
npx bb-app --server-port 48886 --host-daemon-port 48887
```

The Settings → Machines installer assigns every enrolled standalone host daemon
a stable local API port so it can coexist with the desktop app and with daemons
enrolled to other servers. The selected port is persisted in the machine data
directory and reused by subsequent runs. Its generated command accepts
`--host-daemon-port <port>` when an explicit port is required.

## Source Development

For source development only, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm start:worktree`,
`pnpm start:worktree-remote`, `pnpm start:worktree --dryrun`,
and `pnpm start` load the repo-root dotenv
cascade. Add a repo-root `.env` only when you need to override the defaults
described above.

The standard [dotenv-cli](https://github.com/entropitor/dotenv-cli) cascade
applies to source development. `pnpm dev` loads `.env`, `.env.local`,
`.env.development`, and `.env.development.local`, then overrides the instance
selectors (`BB_DATA_DIR`, server URL/port, host-daemon local API port, and Vite
port) with deterministic values derived from the checkout path. The SQLite
database path is always derived from `BB_DATA_DIR`. Both the main server and
Vite app bind to loopback by default; an explicit `BB_DEV_APP_HOST` still
overrides the Vite listener. Remote HTTP dev via `BB_DEV_APP_HOST` also requires
`BB_SERVER_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` for realtime updates; the Tailscale Serve HTTPS
path avoids this because WebSocket traffic goes through the Vite proxy.
`pnpm start:worktree` loads the same development dotenv cascade and uses the
same checkout-specific data directory, server port, and host-daemon port. It
builds production artifacts and serves the frontend bundle from the main
server, so there is no separate Vite listener or hot reload. Telemetry remains
disabled for this source-development command. Its worktree data directory,
ports, inherited skills, listener host, absent Vite port, and telemetry policy
take precedence over conflicting values saved in that instance's `config.json`
or `env.json`.
Add `--dryrun` to `pnpm start` or `pnpm start:worktree` to prepare through Turbo,
print the same resolved ports and paths that normal startup uses, and exit.
This writes build outputs and may repair native modules, but does not start
services, migrate instance data or require ports to be free. Normal startup
also runs Turbo preparation and preserves the command's runtime policy. See
[Prepared Worktree Restarts](debugging-and-qa.md#prepared-worktree-restarts).
`pnpm start:worktree-remote` applies the same policy while binding the main
server to `0.0.0.0` for direct access on a trusted network. The API is
unauthenticated and permits command execution and file reads, so protect the
port with a trusted network boundary such as Tailscale and a host firewall.
`pnpm start` loads `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, and
`.env.production.local`.

Production startup from source uses the same launcher policy as the packaged
app while reading build outputs directly from `apps/app`, `apps/server`, and
`apps/host-daemon`. `pnpm start:host-daemon` continues to run the packaged
`packages/bb-app/dist/bb-app.js host-daemon` entrypoint. Source-only scripts do
not own production ports or data-dir defaults.

Source checkout commands such as `pnpm bb`, `pnpm bb:dev`, and `pnpm reset`
are thin wrappers around `@bb/scripts`. Those wrappers force `NODE_ENV` to the
intended mode so ambient shell state does not silently retarget bb.

Use `pnpm reset` or `pnpm reset:dev` to clear a data directory. These only
remove bb-managed state, not provider credentials.

`BB_PROVIDER_BRIDGE_RECORD_DIR=<dir>` in the host daemon's environment turns
on bridge record mode: every provider bridge writes the lines that cross its
runtime and provider wires as NDJSON under `<dir>/<providerId>/<threadId>/`.
It is a development and diagnostics knob, off by default, and never reaches a
provider child. See [provider-bridge-protocol.md](provider-bridge-protocol.md),
"Record mode", and [debugging-and-qa.md](debugging-and-qa.md). Raw recordings
can contain secrets; redact them with `scripts/provider-recordings/redact.mjs`
before you share them.

## Browser Automation runtime

Agents use `bb browser-automation` through its bundled skill. Screenshot results
contain temporary JPEG paths and the browser host ID; remote captures can be
fetched with `bb file read <path> --host <host-id> --json`. Read or copy images
before closing the session, which deletes its temporary files. Opening a
local headless session also returns a `previewDirective` that the agent pastes
into its message; BB renders it inline as a live preview that expands into a
lightbox. Desktop sessions return none, because
that browser is already visible in the app. There is no setting for it;
collapse the card to pause it.

The Browser Automation plugin supports desktop attachment and headless Chrome on enrolled hosts. Cloud browsers are deferred. The plugin pins one exact `dev-browser` npm release (currently 1.0.0-rc.3) with per-platform binary digests in `plugins/browser-automation/runtime-pin.ts`; the pin, the verification steps, and the bump procedure are documented in `plugins/browser-automation/README.md`.

On each selected browser host, the plugin's host worker installs that release automatically on first use under `<plugin host dataDir>/runtime/npm/`, using the host's `npm` with scripts disabled, verifying the registry signature and SLSA provenance, downloading the matching GitHub release binary, and checking its digest before launch. Later sessions reuse the verified install without network access. Headless mode discovers installed Chrome/Chromium or uses `<plugin host dataDir>/runtime/chrome`. These files belong to the plugin host storage directory; they are not paths on the server or invoking agent host, and the user's global npm installation is never modified. No runtime sandbox-disabling setting is provided.

For isolated development smoke tests only, `DEV_BROWSER_SMOKE_BINARY` selects the absolute binary path for the runtime smoke and `DEV_BROWSER_SMOKE_CHROME` selects the absolute Chrome path. The `smoke:install` task performs a real install of the pinned release into a disposable directory. These variables do not change normal plugin runtime behavior.

## Agent guidance plugin settings

BB guide is installed and enabled by default. In Settings → Installed plugins
→ BB guide, `introduction` controls the BB introduction, `skills` controls all
four bundled skills, and `bbCli`, `pluginAuthoring`, `skillCreator`, and `submitPlugin` control
individual skills. All default to true. Disabling BB guide removes its
introduction and skills; other plugins and independently installed skill
copies retain their own configuration.

Connect's `sendRemoteInstructions` setting ("Tell agents about remote access")
defaults to true. When false it suppresses Connect's active/recent remote-use
message without disabling sharing.

Use `bb plugin config <id> set <key> true|false` or the SDK's
`plugins.updateSettings({ pluginId, values })`. These settings apply when
agent configuration is next assembled, not retroactively to existing text.

### Machine server access

Machines settings expose **Server URL reachable by machines** (`machineServerUrl`)
and **Default machine access** (`defaultMachineAccess`). The URL must be HTTP
or HTTPS without embedded credentials. An unset URL falls back to
`BB_EXTERNAL_URL`. The URL input appears when Manual is selected. An unset access provider selects
bb connect, even when unpaired; Machines settings links to its setup. Choose
Manual (`direct`) explicitly to use your own URL. An explicit provider must
be installed and available. Configure these with `bb settings general
machineServerUrl <url-or-null>` and `bb settings general defaultMachineAccess
<provider-id-or-null>`. `bb settings show --json` reports the effective access
selection. Access grants serve ongoing runtime requests as well as enrolment.

Bootstrap v2 carries optional provider headers. The machine persists them as
`serverHeaders` in its private `config.json`; the launcher supplies them to the
daemon through `BB_SERVER_HEADERS` as a JSON string map. These headers are private
credentials and cover enrollment, HTTP, WebSocket, and runtime proxy requests.
Direct grants omit headers. Legacy `machineCredential` configuration is translated
into the corresponding request header when loading an existing machine.

For machine enrollment, `BB_DATA_DIR` selects isolated machine state instead of
`~/.bb-machines/<server-host>`; a reconnect command defaults to the data
directory the machine's daemon last reported. `bb machine enroll` refuses the default `~/.bb`
directory unless its `host-id` already names this machine, and it refuses a
conflicting host or server identity. Local `bb machine
start|stop|uninstall --host-id <id>` treats `BB_DATA_DIR` (or `--data-dir`) as an
ownership assertion, not permission to act on arbitrary files: lifecycle commands
require a canonical installer-owned directory under `~/.bb-machines` and verify
identity and service/process ownership. Optional `--server-url` asserts the server.
Without an explicit directory, lifecycle commands locate the unique matching host.

### Machine environment

Core resolves machine contributions through
`apps/server/src/services/hosts/host-environment.ts` before dispatching setup and
teardown hooks. Ordinary setup uses `environment.attach`; explicit hooks use
`environment.hook.run`. Both carry transient `contributedEnv` values;
the daemon applies them to the hook child process. Hook progress and errors are
forwarded as-is, so contributed values printed by the child remain visible.
Machine selection and precedence stay in the server
resolver.

Settings → Environment variables is the machine environment editor. Its scope
control sits under the section header and switches between All projects and a
single project. Project settings →
Advanced settings exposes the same editor for that project, where inherited
global variables are listed read-only with an Override action. Project variables
follow the project across machines and worktrees, including the primary host.
Values are encrypted in one `environment_variables` table;
`project_id IS NULL` denotes global scope. Database migration preserves existing
ciphertext from `app_settings_values`. New ciphertext authenticates both scope
and name; legacy global ciphertext remains readable. The server keeps the key
in its data directory's `machine-environment-key` file (mode 0600); back it up
with the database. Names and notes are public metadata; settings APIs never
return saved values. Provider environment diagnostics mask core contributions.
Commands can still print their own environment values.

Built-in credentials are overridden by global variables, then project variables.
Agent-provider contributions retain precedence over these values. Empty strings
are explicit overrides. Deleting a project override restores the inherited value.
Project deletion removes its variables when its database row is removed.

Global values synchronize into every host daemon, including the primary host,
before work, on reconnect, and when settings change. Project values are resolved
by the server and passed only to project operations core runs: agent turns/resume,
source clones, setup/teardown hooks, and new terminals. They never modify the
daemon's global environment. Existing terminals and commands retain
their launch environment. Agent turns receive fresh values on the next turn;
providers reconstruct sessions where needed to apply changed or removed values.

Plugin host calls receive global variables only; they cannot select a project.
A plugin worker keeps its current environment while any of its calls are active,
as before. This means a project override of a credential such as `GH_TOKEN`
applies to the project's clone, setup script, terminals, and agent turns, but
not to git commands an environment provider plugin runs on the machine, which
use the global value. Project-scoped contributions require daemon protocol 211;
older daemons update before the server accepts their session.

For non-primary hosts, the built-in GitHub row uses `gh auth token --hostname
github.com` and `gh api --hostname github.com user` on the server host. It
supplies `GH_TOKEN`, Git's
`GIT_CONFIG_*` environment entries for an HTTPS credential helper and SSH URL
rewrites for github.com, and author/committer identity. The helper expands
`GH_TOKEN` when Git calls it; no helper file, global Git config, or credential
store is installed. The primary host continues using its local Git authentication
unless an explicit global or project `GH_TOKEN` overrides it. Private email uses
`<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com`.
A user `GH_TOKEN` overrides the built-in token, and the row shows overridden.
Tokens obtained from gh are never persisted by the server. Image construction
and Modal filesystem snapshot settings do not receive these contributions.

Use `bb machine env list`, `bb machine env set NAME [--note text]`, and
`bb machine env unset NAME`; all accept `--project <id>` and `--json`.
Omitting `--project` retains global behavior. Set reads stdin, removes one
trailing newline, and never accepts a value in argv. For example:
`printf '%s' staging | bb machine env set DEPLOY_REGION --project proj_example`.

SDK parity: `sdk.system.machineEnvironment`, `replaceMachineEnvironment`,
`setMachineEnvironmentVariable`, and `deleteMachineEnvironmentVariable` manage
global values. The same methods under `sdk.projects` take `projectId`.
Set/delete mutate one variable atomically. Replacement atomically replaces one
scope, with `value: null` retaining an existing secret; missing saved values
are rejected. Project reads return `variables` and `inheritedVariables`, with
`value: null` and `secret: true` for every row. `builtInGit` reports effective
GitHub credential readiness.

Automatic GitHub credential forwarding to non-primary hosts is enabled by default. Use
`bb settings general machineGitCredentialsEnabled false` to stop forwarding the
server gh credentials to machines; `true` enables them again. In Settings →
Environment variables, the automatic GH_TOKEN switch controls the same setting.
This does not log the server out or suppress an explicit custom GH_TOKEN.
Changes apply to new turns, setup commands and terminals.

## Modal machines

The optional Modal sandbox plugin builds/reuses named tools images for new
machines. Its plugin page keeps the bundled Standard Dockerfile as the first
image and can add named Dockerfiles, existing Modal image IDs, and named CPU/memory
presets. CLI: `bb modal image show`, `bb modal image set --file PATH`, and
`bb modal image reset` (append `--json`). Typed plugin RPCs `image.definition`,
`image.set({dockerfile})`, and `image.reset` expose the same persistent definition.
Supported instructions are one FROM followed by RUN, ENV, WORKDIR, and USER; no
build context or multi-stage builds. Saving does not build or modify existing
machines. The next new machine uses the saved definition. BB installs the daemon
on demand, then clones the project and runs its setup hook.

Configure `tokenId` and `tokenSecret` in secret plugin settings; `appName` defaults
to `bb-sandboxes`. With no size preset, Modal's CPU and memory defaults apply.
`idleMinutes` defaults to 15 (0 disables idle suspension), and `timeoutMinutes`
defaults to 1440 with an allowed range of 1–1440. Existing machines use current idle
policy; running compute keeps its vendor deadline and restored compute uses the
current lifetime. Resource reservations stay pinned across restore.

There is no automatic retention removal. Use `bb machine remove MACHINE --yes`
for explicit cleanup. Manual and idle pauses save a filesystem snapshot before
terminating compute. There is no pre-expiry scheduler: a sandbox that stays active
until its configured timeout can lose changes since its last successful pause.
Provider details expose expiry and saved-image status; missing compute never
silently restores stale state. Open terminals prevent idle suspension.

`bb modal account inspect --json` tests credentials without allocating resources.
Create with `bb machine create --provider modal-sandbox --project PROJECT --json`.
See [modal-sandboxes](../plugins/environment-modal-sandbox/skills/modal-sandboxes/SKILL.md)
for prerequisites and lifecycle commands.

## Repository build caches

App production builds persist validated React Compiler transform results at
`<git-common-dir>/bb-cache/react-compiler`, shared safely across this
repository's worktrees. Non-Git checkouts use Vite's cache directory. Missing,
invalid, or corrupt entries are rebuilt; development and compiler diagnostic
modes bypass the cache. The cache has no user configuration and can be removed
while no builds are running. See [build performance](build-performance.md) for
its identity, portability, and verification contract.

Anonymous usage telemetry can be disabled in Settings → General → Privacy & diagnostics → Share anonymous usage data,
or with `bb settings general telemetryEnabled false`. The saved server-wide preference
takes effect immediately and persists across restarts. SDK callers can use
`system.updateGeneralSettings` with `telemetryEnabled`. `BB_TELEMETRY=false`
always disables telemetry, even when the saved preference is enabled.

### Thread list provider icons, read status grouping, and lifecycle filter

The Thread list plugin's `showProviderIcons` preference defaults to `true`.
Organize → Rows → Provider icons or
`bb thread-list prefs set showProviderIcons false` hides the agent provider
icon before each thread title. Unknown provider ids have no icon.

The `groupByReadStatus` preference defaults to `false`. Organize → Groups →
By read status or `bb thread-list prefs set groupByReadStatus true` lists
threads that show an unread dot above the rest, keeping the selected sort within
each group. Parent threads start collapsed while it is on, without changing the
saved collapsed state. The open thread keeps its place until another thread is
opened, and pinned threads keep their manual order. It is exclusive with By
environment: while it is on, worktree threads are not grouped.

The Thread list plugin's `threadLifecycles` preference selects `["active"]`
(the default), `["archived"]`, or `["active","archived"]`. Set it with
`bb thread-list prefs set threadLifecycles '["archived"]'` or the header's
Filter menu. It syncs to every window and rejects empty or duplicate values.

## Desktop browser cookie discovery

The desktop app combines known-browser definitions with schema-based discovery
of Chromium and Firefox cookie stores matched to registered web browsers.
Known-browser entries remain available without registration metadata.
On Linux, an absolute `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
in the desktop process environment replaces `~/.config` for discovery and known
Chromium profile locations; relative values are ignored. Flatpak and Snap data
directories are also searched. On macOS, discovery searches Application Support.
The desktop app's own profile is excluded. See `bb guide browser` for search
bounds, encryption limitations, and the `import-sources` / `import-cookies`
commands. No additional BB setting is required to enable discovery.

### Mobile app downloads

Mobile app downloads are always available in Settings → Mobile (`/settings/mobile`).
**Join iOS TestFlight** opens https://testflight.apple.com/join/T9MayTMb.
**Download Android APK** downloads directly from the public `get-bb/bb` GitHub
`android-testing` release's `bb-android.apk` asset. The APK does not pass through
the bb server or bb connect. No experiment or Android developer tools are needed.
Pair either app through Settings → Mobile → **Add mobile device**.

Use `bb settings mobile-app --json` or SDK `system.mobileAppDownloads()` to get
both public links. Add `--details --json` or call `system.mobileAppReleases()`
(GET `/api/v1/system/mobile-app-releases`) for Android version/build, size, and
upload date. The server fetches only public metadata, caches it for five minutes,
and returns `android: null` if unavailable or inconsistent. Download links remain
usable during metadata failures. iOS version and release date are shown in TestFlight.
Publish updates with **Mobile Android (EAS)**, profile `preview`, **publish** on.

The publishing workflow verifies the signed APK and publishes both the checksum-named
asset and the stable `bb-android.apk` alias, then `latest.json`.

### Server performance diagnostics

`BB_PERF_DIAGNOSTICS=1` permits opt-in CPU profiling and detailed server
performance logs; the default is false. Restart to change it. The launcher
flag `pnpm start --perf-diagnostics` (also `pnpm start:worktree` and `bb-app`)
grants permission for that launch; the experiment must also be on. See [diagnostics](debugging-and-qa.md#opt-in-server-performance-diagnostics)
for capture retention, overhead, and interpretation.

Diagnostics require **both** startup permission (`--perf-diagnostics` or
`BB_PERF_DIAGNOSTICS=1`) and the **Server performance diagnostics** toggle in
Settings → Experiments. The toggle is only shown when startup permission is present; a saved experiment value does not make it visible. The experiment defaults to off. Use
`bb settings experiment performanceDiagnostics true` to enable it, or `false`
to stop it; SDK clients use the existing experiments update endpoint. The
experiment takes effect live on that server. Without startup permission it
cannot start collection. Turning it off restores normal logging thresholds,
stops the sampler and flushes the in-flight profile; existing files remain.
The launch flag only grants permission and still requires a restart to change.
